Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Gabby! 
Student: Hi Dani! I'm having trouble picking my classes for next semester. Do you have any suggestions of good classes? 
Student: Are you there? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are you looking to take more EECS classes? 
Student: Yeah! I am thinking about taking an EECS class 
Student: What is the first class I should take 
Student: ? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 183 is the first EECS course 
Student: Okay great. What do I learn in that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You learn all about the basics of programming 
Student: Awesome! I've never programmed before but I want to learn. Will I be able to keep up with the class? 
Student: Someone told me it's really hard and a lot of work and I'm worried I'll fall behind 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you work hard and keep up with the projects, then you should be able to do well! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You've taken a lot of hard engineering classes, so I think you'd be fine! 
Student: Good to know! 
Student: Can I take any other EECS classes with it? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Actually you have to wait to pass 183 to take other classes. UGH I KNOW 
Student: UGH are you serious??? 
Student: how ill i ever graduate on time????? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Well do you want an EECS degree? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Or do you just want to take some classes? 
Student: Idk yet 
Student: but I might want to be a CS major 
Student: I'm still trying to decide 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Why don't you try out EECS 183 and see how you like it first 
Student: that sounds like a good plan! I'll do that 
Student: thanks for your help dani! 
Student: i'll let you know how it goes 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye my sweet pea!!! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  HELLO! What can I do for you today? 
Student: I'm here to ask about what courses to take next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What are you looking to accomplish this semester? 
Student: I'm looking to take EECS281 sometime in the future. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then do I have the course for you! EECS 203 is a pretty easy class for someone of your standing, and it sets you up perfectly to take EECS 281 next semester. 
Student: That sounds great!  What time is it being taught? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 is taught in the afternoon at around 3pm. 
Student: That aligns with my preference.  How heavy is the workload of EECS203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 is generally considered an easy class, but those with less math background have struggled in the past, which you shouldn't have to worry about. 
Student: Perfect! How big is the class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The average class size is around 55 people. 
Student: I generally don't like big classes, so this works for me! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Perfect! Do you have any more questions? 
Student: Nope, I don't have anymore questions.  You've been very helpful! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Glad to hear it. You have a nice day now! 

Student: Hey, I'm looking for easy classes. Any suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest EECS 183. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in learning more about programming? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Great! Then I'm sure you will enjoy the class. :) 
Student: Thank you! I will be signing up for EECS 183. 

Student: Hi 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How can I help you? 
Student: What classes should I take over the summer? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What is your major? 
Student: Computer Science Engineering 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  And your year? 
Student: Junior underad 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken your Upper level cs courses? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would recommend making sure you finish your engineering requirements or your upper level courses over the summer. 
Student: thanks 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Maverick 
Student: What's up prof? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you need a class recommendation? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I have a lot of recommendations to give you. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What are you looking for? 
Student: I am looking for classes that are fairly easy. 
Student: Also I would like something that is in the afternoon 
Student: I enjoy the electrical engineering classes 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I don't see many easy classes that fit that description. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you want EE or Easy? 
Student: Ok I will just take any easy class. Since im a senior. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Take EECS 484. It's pretty easy 
Student: Ok thanks doc. That's all I need. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  My pleasure. 

Student: Hello there! 
Student: I was wondering what else I need to graduate. 
Student: I've taken all the major requirements, what is next? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hey there, let me take a look! 
Student: Ok souds great! 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Wow, you're a playa in this major. I don't understand why you want to take more CS classes, you have fulfilled everything. Go out and party! 
Student: Are you sure I don't need a Major Design class? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Oh jeebuzesus, I didn't see that, yes, you will need to take a MDE. 
Student: Ok what are my options there? 
Student: Lay off the dad jokes too, please. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Most popular ones are 441, 494, and 481! 
Student: Ok sounds great! 
Student: See ya! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye! 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Good morning! What can I help you with? 
Student: I'm really worried because I think I'm going to fail one of my classes. 
Student: And then I won't graduate. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which class is that? 
Student: EECS 388. I just really really hate buffers and I don't understand assembly. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Okay, you will need 4 upper level CS courses to graduate. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Is this one of them? 
Student: I'm not sure. Can you tell me which classes I've taken will count for my upper level CS classes? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Unfortunately, the system is down and I cannot pull it up, but you can access the information from the eecs website online. 
Student: How do I find the eecs website online? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Google. 
Student: Oh, thanks! I'll do that. 
Student: Bye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Anna, what can I help you with today? 
Student: I need two more upper level CS classes. Which ones should I take? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you interested in Artificial Intelligence? Or are you more interested in Databases? 
Student: I like both. And there are many AI-type classes but idk which ones are important. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take EECS 492 as an introduction to AI. It's an ULCS and 4 credits. 
Student: Cool 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 442 is another good AI and Machine Learning type course 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is also an ULCS 
Student: Good to know. I will consider all of them. 
Student: I want to take a fun and neat class next semester. What is cool and fun? What are the cool kids doing these days? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I see that you have taken PSYCH 111. Did you enjoy PSYCH? 
Student: No I thought PSYCH was boring! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 441 is about Mobile Applications. You might be interested in that. That is what the media is calling cool and hip nowadays. 
Student: Rad 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I'm sorry you didn't like PSYCH. Some people really love the subject. 
Student: I can see that being true. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I also suggest you looking into Ceramics courses. There is a ceramics course for non-majors offered here! 
Student: That sounds like so much fun! 
Student: I'll consider it. 
Student: That's all I have for now. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  It was great talking to you! Let me know if you need anything else. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Yo yo yo! how is it going my boiii 
Student: watup home skillet i gucci 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see you are a sophomore. What major are you interested? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would suggest the most superior major of Computer Science in Engineering 
Student: ok but i am interested in botany 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  What interests you about botony? 
Student: plant reproduction ;) 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see, would you be interested in taking some biology courses then? 
Advisor: [push-other]  I see that you have not taken any yet. 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If that is the case, I would suggest that you take bio 171, or a similar introductory biology course 
Student: nah next 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  What are your other interests in courses to take? 
Student: gender studies 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  On a specific gender, or the current culture of our world? 
Student: specifically the cactus male 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see, I believe there is an introductory course in asexual plant reproduction, focusing on the Cactaceae plant family. I would suggest that class. 
Student: incredible. You are the best advisor ever 
Advisor: [social-other]  Thank you! I strive to provide the best information to my students. 
Student: how's you day going 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  So that is the first class, what other classes would you like to take? 
Advisor: [social-other]  And my day is going well, thank you. 
Student: I want to take EECS281 
Student: EECS 370 and EECS376 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are you looking to take some EECS classes to round out your semester? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-other]  For a CS major or minor, all three of those classes are required, and I believe they would fit well with the botony/biology class I suggested. 
Student: That sounds excellent I will do that 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a nice day! 
Student: thx 

Student: I need help 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Jskollin, WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH? 
Student: I really did not like EECS 475 
Student: Are there certain classes that cover similar concepts that I should avoid? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Great Question! If you did not like 475, I would suggest that you stay away from eecs 388! 
Student: What is EECS 388? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Eecs 388 is a computer security class.  What other topics are you interested in? 
Student: I dont know yet. I have only taken that course. 
Student: What are popular upper level computer science courses that you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  When I was a student I took courses such as eecs485 and eecs493.  I enjoyed both of these classes very much. 
Student: What is EECS 485 and EECS 493/ 
Student: ? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Eecs485 is an "ALL THINGS WEB DEV" type of class and Eecs493 is a User Interface class.  These classes have a lot of nice overlap so they are good courses to take together! 
Student: Thanks for all the help 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sure thing, Good luck! 

Student: How's it going? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Great! What can I help you with? 
Student: I was wondering what sort of upper level CS classes should I take? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Okay, what sort of segments of computer science are you interested in? 
Student: I'm really into back-end type systems. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You should take EECS 482 
Student: Okay. How heavy is the courseload for that? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is definitely a good amount of work, but you will be able to handle it. 
Student: Oh okay. What would be a good class to take with it within EECS? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take other classes outside of EECS to finish up other requirements. 
Student: I already have though. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Okay, then take some classes that are more team-based like EECS 485. 
Student: But I'm not interested in frond-end development. Would you recommend 484? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  484 will teach you more about databases, so it seems you are more interested in that. 
Student: Alright, great I'll take those then 
Student: Thank you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Awesome! No worries, have a great day Tanvir! 

Student: What class should i take for next semster 
Advisor: [pull-select]  what do you want to take? 
Student: What's your recommandations? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I think you need take EECS281 
Student: i want to take it with Physics 888, can I survive? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS281 is heavy work load 
Student: So what are some easy class I can take with 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS376 
Student: WTF 
Student: I heard it is an extremly hard class 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You can do this if you try very hard. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Do you like EECS370 
Student: nO 
Student: sORRY 
Student: I really like to take class at morning 
Student: Do you have any recommandation? 
Student: I want clarifyrating greater than 4 
Student: dfadf

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hallo Varsha! 
Advisor: [social-other]  Sprichste du Deutsch? 
Student: Nein 
Advisor: [social-other]  I'm so happy to see that you learned during your year abroad in Freiburg! 
Student: Thanks, I learned everything except how to speak German 
Advisor: [social-other]  Well I hope you learned some computer science too! 
Student: they call it googling there 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What can I help you with today? 
Student: I'm trying to decide between EECS 482 and EECS 381 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would recommend neither. Neither EECS 482 nor EECS 381 are on your suggested course list. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  How about EECS 481 or EECS 477? 
Student: What are those? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I'm so glad you asked! EECS 481 is Software Engineering and EECS 477 is Algorithms. 
Student: Is EECS 481 an MDE? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, EECS 481 is an MDE. 
Student: What else do I have to take with me MDE? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are in LSA or CoE? 
Student: I'm in CoE 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Unfortunately, you also have to techcomm and EECS 496 with your MDE. 
Student: Ah bummer 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Techcomm and EECS 496 aren't too bad don't worry 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It also looks like you're a junior. Most people take their MDE when they are a senior. 
Student: Oh okay I will wait to take EECS 481 until next year 
Student: Thanks for your help! 

Student: Hi! I'm wondering what classes I should take next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok. What type of classes are you interested in? 
Student: I have a lot of interests: Computer Hardware, Software Development, Web tech and apps, and Computing infrastructure. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  It sounds like you're interested in Computer Science. Are you looking to take a harder class or an easier class in computer science next semester? 
Student: I'm looking to take something of medium to hard difficulty. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I'd recommend you take EECS 280 or EECS 203 then. Both of those are medium to hard difficulty. 
Student: How are the professors teaching those classes next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Martha E Pollack is teaching EECS 203. She is about medium on helpfulness and about medium on clarity. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Holly Christine Sipek is teaching EECS 280. She is pretty helpful and pretty clear. 
Student: What alternatives do I have to EECS 280 and EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You could take EECS 183. It's a bit easier than EECS 280 and EECS 203. 
Student: Sounds good, thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem! 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: What courses should I take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What has been your favorite class so far? 
Student: My favorite class so far was ENGR 406: High-Tech Entrepreneurship 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I would like you to elaborate why. What was it about the class that interested you so much? 
Student: I liked that the class had group projects. I also liked that the class covered finance models. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Your entrepreneurship class must have been a great break from your other EECS classes! But it is definitely time to get serious about your school work. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking for a class that has an emphasis on group work? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Hmm, fascinating. How do you feel about class size? Do you want a large class or a small class? 
Student: I am interested in larger classes. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ahh, I see. I think you would really benefit from taking EECS 281 next semester. Although there is not a ton of group work in this class, the class size and rigor will be to your liking. 
Student: Thank you! I will take EECS 281 next semester. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Your happiness is my happiness! Stay fabulous. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi ,how are you?What can I do for you? 
Student: Yeah. I am here today for some suggestions about the graduation requirment . 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I have seen your transcript and I find that you have to take EECS 484 to graduate. 
Student: yeah. That's exactly what I want to take next term. 
Student: But I find that there is no 484 class openning. 
Student: What can I do? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Then you have EECS 494 and 493 to choose as your backup? Which one do you prefer? 
Student: Well, I think I am more likely to choose EECS494. 
Student: I love games. 
Student: I need to apply for a graduate school so I want to have a more challenging course to keep me up with the life in as a graduate student. 
Student: What do you think? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  So according to you workload request. EECS 467 is a good choice. 
Student: what about the time? 
Student: Sometimes I need to take my part time job during the night. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Don't worry. This class starts at 10:00 in the morning and ends at 12:00 in the noon. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello

Student: all of them 
Student: I believe you may have heard 'a lot of credits', but what I said was 'All of the credits' 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  students can take up to 18 credits a semester 
Student: That will do 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  students of your major need to take EECS203 and EECS280 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take both next semester 
Student: How commonly are those taken together? 
Student: Is it possible to take more EECS classes with them? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take both next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  take both next semester gdi 
Student: Sounds gooch! What other classes can I take to fill up those 18?

Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you are interested in computer hardware, I strongly suggest you take EECS470 
Student: if i must 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would also suggest taking EECS478 -- logic circuit synthesis and optimization 
Student: Okay 
Student: I would like a workload of precisely 5 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Those two classes together have an easiness rating of 2+. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take an easy non-CS class to balance the workload. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  For next semester, you can take EECS 381 -- Object Oriented and Advanced Programming. 
Student: Okay sounds easy 
Student: thank you 
Student: have a nice day

Student: Should I take EECS 203 or EECS 280 first? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Would you rather improve your programming skills or your mathematical foundations? 
Student: I think I would rather improve my programming skills... 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then I suggest taking EECS 280 if you would like to improve your programming skills. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: Nah 
Student: Thank you! 
Student: This was very helpful. 
Advisor: [social-other]  I'm glad I was able to help. 

Student: HI!!!! I NEED YOUR HELP!!!!! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  OMG HOW CAN I HELP YOU? 
Student: Sorry my caps lock was on. Please don't scream at your advisee. 
Student: What do you recommend I take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in Data Structures and Algorithms? 
Student: No, please check your privilege. I'm interested in things other than computer science. 
Student: But I know I have to take more computer science classes. What is Data Structures and Algorithms about? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 281, Data Structures and Algorithms, is about data structures and algorithms. 
Student: Can you please provide more information? What are my tax dollars supporting here, anyways? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  281 covers algorithms like sorts and recursion, and data structures like graphs and queues 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Your tax dollars are going down the drain. 
Student: Well, that's not a good thought, but at least I'm privileged enough to say my parents are paying my way through college and I don't have any student loans. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Student: What is the class size like? I want to be around 100 people, if possible. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The class size is roughly 80 people, which is as close to 100 as any other class. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interest and class standing, I recommend that you take EECS 281. 
Student: What is the clarity rating? I like classes with an average clarity rating. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 has an average clarity rating. It is literally perfect for you! 
Student: But I don't want to :( 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your severe attitude problems, I think you should take 470. It will build character. 
Student: What is 470? Does it involve anthropology? I really liked ANTHRCUL 101! 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  It can be about anthropology if you use your imagination! 
Student: Awww, thanks Dr. S! You are a ray of sunshine in my dark, bleak world. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye dude 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Peace 

Student: Help me, I have no idea which classes to take 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok well, lets see. What are you interested in? 
Student: I am really interested in robotics and things involving robots. Any advice? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That's a very cool area! Before you take such specific courses though, you will have to take courses like eecs370 and eecs281 
Student: Will I be too overwhelmed if I take them at the same time? 
Student: Can I take them at the same time? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Back when I was a young lad, I took them at the same time.  And yes, its a lot of work.  But definitely doable! 
Student: Thanks! 

Student: Hey, I'm looking for some easy classes to take. What would you suggest? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on the suggestions on your transcript, I would say EECS 370. 
Student: Does it have the largest class size compared to your other suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, EECS 370 has the largest class size compared to my other suggestions. 
Student: Oh okay, thank you! I will be signing up for EECS 370. 

Student: Hey, what class do you think I should take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking for graduate level classes? 
Student: No. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  So, you're looking for undergraduate level classes? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would sugget either EECS 373 or EECS 475. 
Student: Which one has the bigger class size? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 475 has a bigger class size than EECS 373. 
Student: Okay, thank you. I will be enrolling in EECS 475. 

Student: Hello, I need help picking classes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok, what kind of classes are you interested in? 
Student: I am interested web technology and applications. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Ok, I might recommend that you take EECS 484, Database Management Systems, or EECS 475, Intro to Crypto. We don't have a web class to recommend, but these two technologies are frequently used on the web. 
Student: Which class is easier? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 475 is easier than 484. 
Student: What are the class sizes for EECS 475? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 475 has a class size of 64 students. 
Student: Ok, are there any classes related software development? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you're interested in software, I'd recommend you take EECS 494, Computer Game Design and Development. 
Student: What time is that class offered ? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  We actually don't have a time for 494 yet, come back later and we might have a time for you! 
Student: OK. Thank you very much. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Not a problem! 

Student: Hello professor. How are you? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, nice to meet you? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Do you have any problem today? 
Student: I'm a Junior student. So what courses do you suggest me take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What kind of course you've already taken? 
Student: I have taken some computer science cousres, some math, physics, theory and chemical courses, etc. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What topic you think you like the most? 
Student: I think computer science is more interesting. 
Student: So what kind of courses do you suggest? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  I 've seen your transcript. Which one do you like more, Introduction to computer Organization or Computer architecture? 
Student: I think it is computer architecture, for this course is more challenge. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  That cool. I think you can take EECS 485, I can try the workload and see if you can handle it. 
Student: Fine, I will try that. Thank you. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Nice. Go for it. 

Advisor: [pull-other]  Hi how can I help? 
Student: Hey, I'm trying to figure out which EECS class to take next 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Sure, are you looking for core fundamental classes or more specific subjects? 
Student: I want to take the next course in the usual progression 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Seeing that you've taken 281 already, I'd highly suggest 376 or 307 next. 
Student: I've already decided to take 370 and I heard 376 is really not fun. Are there others I can consider instead? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case, I'd suggest 484 if you're interested in learning about databases or 494 if you're interested in learning how to develop games. 
Student: Cool. 494 sounds like something I'd want to look into 
Student: Do you know if that class is hard? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's definitely not going to be the easiest class but it will be helpful for sure. 
Student: Do you have info on what exactly one might learn in that class? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Yes, you'll be learning about concepts and methods about creating video games, including the history of games, animations, sprites, and game design. 
Student: That sounds pretty awesome. I think I'll take it, thanks! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, what did you need help with today? 
Student: I'm wondering about what class to take next. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It seems like you've taken many EECS courses 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you a CS major? 
Student: Yes! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ok, then there's many courses that you can take next 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Some include 485, 492 and 494 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  But there's many options available for you to check out 
Student: Which ULCS is easiest? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I don't believe that it is wisest to just choose the easiest course available 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Instead, you should choose something you want to do! 
Student: Wise advice!  I want to be a web dev when I grow up.  Any recommendations? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Perfect, then I would suggest you take 485, its called Web Databases 
Student: Is DeOrio a good prof? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I wouldn't know, but I'm sure he's great 
Student: Thanks 
Student: Goodbye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! What can I help you with? 
Student: Hello! I'm trying to schedule classes for next semester. Can you help me? 
Student: I am really interested in hardware 
Student: But I don't want too hard of classes 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  So are you interested in pursuing Electrical or Computer Engineering? 
Student: I'm undecided 
Student: I like programming as well, but I am a little more interested in hardware 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Computer Engineering has both programming and hardware aspects to it. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I think it will be a good fit for you. 
Student: Awesome, I think that's some good advice. 
Student: What classes should I take to become a Computer Engineer? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You haven't taken EECS 203, 280, and 270, so it may be in your best interest to take one or two of those classes next semester 
Student: Ok. Which of those is in the morning. I like morning classes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  They have not released the schedule for next semester yet. 
Student: Ok. 
Student: Do you suggest taking all three of those together? Or would that be too hard? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That may be a lot of work, particularly in the EECS department. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you look into some classes that are more fun. 
Student: Ok. Thank you! 
Student: You've been tremendously helpful 
Student: Thx 
Student: Bai 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how is your course these days? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  How is your homework this week? 
Student: What a busy week. 
Student: This semester I have taken different courses in math, chemical, physics, and economy, etc. I'm little confused about what to take next semeter? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What do you think about the workload of thes courses you took? 
Student: Actually, I think all the courses all kind of boring and I want to try something different next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What about computer science? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Did you give a try in Programming and Data structure? 
Student: No. But l'd like to give a try. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Oh yes. The course EECS280 is a huge class and it is really helpful if you want to find a job after you graduate. 
Student: What about the workload? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Of course it's a hard one. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  But don't worry. There is a EECS 183, which is much easier for people who don't have much experience in computer science like you. 
Student: I think I will take both to face more challenge. 

Student: HI!! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  what can I help you with? 
Student: I'm not sure what class to take 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well, since you are a sophomore and it looks like you are on a computer science track, I suggest you take EECS 203 
Student: Okay but I'm not sure if i wanna do CS 
Student: How many classes do i need to take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You need to take about 54 more credits to graduate 
Student: Cool! 
Student: How much work is 203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is an average course for computer science 
Student: cool 
Student: ill take it next semester 
Student: thanks 
Student: xo 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye! 

Student: hi 
Student: I have trouble selecting classes to take next semester. could you give me some advice? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in database? 
Student: Yes. kind of 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 484 is a good course for learning database. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think that's helpful 
Student: Who is the instructor for the course? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's Micheal John 
Student: Oh I know him 
Student: any other suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  He's a good professor 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 370 is also a great course for your major. 
Student: What does this course talk about? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It will help you learn about computer organization. 
Student: Sounds interesting. 
Student: I will consider. 
Student: Thanks. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Hope you a great semester 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good evening, Stefan 
Student: Hi. I was hoping you could give me some information on some upper level courses. What is 445 like? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Professor Honglak Lee's class back in the day was very good. Highly reccommended 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  445 requires linear algebra and some statistics, though. 
Student: Oh I heard that guy is pretty hard but very good if you want to learn the material. I'm trying to get into machine learning. 
Student: I haven't taken linear algebra. Should I take that first? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No, you could learn it during the class. Just be prepared to spend a bit more time on it 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Linear algebra mostly amounts to keeping track of what the matrix sizes are anyway. 
Student: I'm really interested in computer vision, too. Is EECS 442 a good course? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, the course alternates between CSE and ECE professors, but I know that Jia Deng is good. 
Student: Oh I heard he is the one who created ImageNet. Is that true? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes. He also works with Professor Rada in semantic understanding and general action recognition. 
Student: Wow that sounds exciting. I am hoping to get into semantic understanding using multimodal feature embeddings for both video and language. I guess I'll have to start with 445 and 442, however. I guess I'll think a little about what other two courses I should take with them. I'll send you an email with what I decide. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should join the Michigan Data Science Team and follow Deng on facebook since he posts a lot of random but relevant stuff. 
Student: Ok will do. Thanks a lot. See you later. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Glad to help. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! How can I help you? 
Student: Hi! I need help deciding what to take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How hard was EECS280 and EECS203? 
Student: I thought they were pretty decent, not too hard of a workload 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How did you feel about EECS203? Was the material interesting, did you find it difficult? 
Student: I thought it was interesting and not too difficult but I enjoyed EECS280 a lot more 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you really feel like working like crazy but you also want to get a lot of prerequisites out of the way, you could take EECS370, EECS376, and EECS281, but that's quite a difficult combination. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you want to play it safe, EECS281, EECS376, and another 4 credit class might be a better option. 
Student: How difficult of a workload is EECS281 and EECS376 compared to EECS280 and EECS203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I'd say that EECS281 on its own is about the difficulty of EECS280 and EECS203. EECS370 is about as hard as EECS370. 
Advisor: [push-other]  Rather, EECS370 is about as hard as EECS280. 
Student: I think I will take EECS281 and EECS376 next semester along with another 4 credit class 
Student: Thanks for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sure, have a nice day! 

Student: Hi how are ya 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, there. What can I do for you? 
Student: I'm looking for an easy semester that is still helpful. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you thought about Design of Microprocessor Based Systems? 
Student: No because I can't see the future courses but that sounds interesting.  What is the workload and class size? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's 4 credits with a class size of about 40. 
Student: I'd prefer to have a class of either 2 to 3 credits, or have a larger class size. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You seem like you would be interested in EECS 567. 
Student: What is EECS 567? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Robotic Kinematics and Dynamics. 
Student: Is there a class more on the computer side, like Theory of Computation or Computing Infrastructure? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Well, EECS 573 Microarchitecture is only 3 credits is said to be on the easier side, but the class size is around 30 students. 
Student: Despite the class size, the topic seems interesting and the rest fits well with my schedule. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would recommend smaller classrooms, because they are more hands on. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Glad I could help. Don't hesitate to come again if you need any more help. 
Student: Thank you very much. 

Student: Hey 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Tanvir. How are you? 
Student: I'm good. How are you? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I'm great! How may I assist you today? 
Student: I was wondering if you could suggest what classes I should take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Sure! Are you considering computer science as a major? 
Student: Yes, I've really enjoyed taking those classes so far. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Great! Are you interested in web developmet? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Awesome! EECS 485 is a great class to take. You should consider taking that the semester after you take EECS 281. 
Student: Great! But first can you tell me what to take next semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Sure. I suggest you take EECS 281 and EECS 376 together. 
Student: Why do you say so? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  281 is programming heavy. 376 is more theoretical based. It will be a good mix. 
Student: Okay. And for my other 2 classes? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Just take classes outside of your major that you are interested in like cooking. 
Student: Okay. Thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sure, no problem! 
Student: Have a good day. 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [push]  What can I help you with? 
Student: I have a question regarding what classes to take next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It seems you have taken a lot of different classes 
Student: Yeah which is why I'm kind of lost on what to take next 
Student: Do you have any suggestions? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like Math? 
Student: Sure I loved the math classes I took! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Go with your gut 
Student: What classes should I take then? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  MATH 425, probability is a good one 
Student: Any other suggestions? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are you interested in anything else? 
Student: Engineering 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  ENGIN 100 is good 
Student: Ok, thanks for your time! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Thanks, bye 

Advisor: [pull-other]  How are you? 
Student: Hello advisor, I am fine, how about yourself? 
Student: Is EECS 280 a good class for me to take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  280 is a great class. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken ENGR 101 
Student: Yes I felt it was straightforward 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Then EECS 280 sounds like a good choice 
Student: Oh wait I already took EECS 280 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You could take EECS 203 
Student: I meant to say EECS281 
Student: Is EECS 203 a pre-requisite for EECS 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You cannot take 281 without taking 203 
Student: Ok thank you 
Advisor: [pull-other]  glad I could help 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello young padawan 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Help you how I may? 
Student: Yes, I don't know who my father is. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Problem this is 
Student: Yes, and the weather in tataouine sucks 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Help I cannot, but advising classes I can 
Student: Anyways, I have been thinking about what to take next semester 
Student: I see that there is a special topics course on Distributed Systems. How do special topics courses differ from ULCS's? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Special topics are usually classes focused around a faculties areas of interest/research. They are offered on a per semester basis. Some of them count for ULCS but you should always check to be sure 
Student: Okay. How is Harsha? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I am not sure how he is as a professor. I would suggest asking classmates who have taken his courses 
Student: I also don't know who my friends are. 
Student: I seem to lose people. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Don't confuse your sister for your lover 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Feel the force 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is there anything else about classes I can help you with? 
Student: The force does not seem to help in my classes. 
Student: No, you have been very helpful 
Student: I will go to master yoda 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Force push yourself to an A 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodluck! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how can I help you? 
Student: Hello there, I need help choosing classes this semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What year of study are you in? 
Student: I am a SEnior 
Advisor: [push-other]  I will look at your transcript 
Student: Thanks! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you haven't taken EECS 281 which is a prerequisite for most upper-level EECS classes 
Student: So you think I should take 281 then? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You need to take this class to graduate 
Student: I will take the class.  Anything else you recommend? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in logic circuit synthesis and optimization? 
Student: Yes!  I will take those classes 
Student: Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem, bye now 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Mingyang! How are you doing? 
Student: Hi advisor. I am doing well. I would like to get some help from you to select courses for next semester. 
Student: My interested area is Software Development and Intelligent system. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You may want to consider EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, and EECS381 Object Oriented and Advanced Programming. 
Student: I like challenging courses. What are the difficulty levels for these classes? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS492 and EECS481 are rated as medium, but EECS381 is rated as very hard. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  How do you feel about that? 
Student: That looks like a fair difficulty level. How about their time schedule in the week? I prefer afternoon classes then morning classes. If the time is too early, I will consider switch to other courses. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS381 is in the afternoon. The other two are in the morning.EECS481 is 9:00-10:30, and EECS492 is 10:30-12:00. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You might not want to take 481. It is too early in the morning, and it's sort of similar to EECS381. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  How do you feel about EECS494 Computer Game Design and Development? It's in the afternoon, and it matches your interest. It is also decently hard. 
Student: Can you recommend me another interesting course that is in the afternoon and I hope it can also have a high clarity. 
Student: Sounds like a good match. How about its clarity level? Will the professors be able to make their lectures easy to be understood? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS494 has got a high clarity rating too. 
Student: Oh wow, That is awesome! 
Student: I guess that is it about my questions! Thank you for your suggestions. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Glad that I could be helpful 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good luck 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Greetings! 
Student: I need help picking courses for next semester 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Well, let me help you with that Mr. Buckingham 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on the classes you've taken, I think you would do well registering in EECS 280, 208 and 203 for the Computer science side of things 
Student: Who is teaching EECS 280 next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Prof Brian Noble will be teaching 280 next semester. 
Student: What kind of professor is he? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Mr. Noble is a pretty good guy based on what I've heard. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you'd like, you can register for the class and see for yourself. 
Student: What is the course content in EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Techniques and algorithm development and effective programming, top-down analysis, structured programming, testing, and program correctness. Program language syntax and static and runtime semantics. Scope, procedure instantiation, recursion, abstract data types, and parameter passing methods. Structured data types, pointers, linked data structures, stacks, queues, arrays, records, and trees 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Would be the description of EECS 280. 
Student: Thank you! I will take that into consideration 
Advisor: [social-other]  Good. 
Student: That was all I needed! Have a great day! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  I wish you a pleasant journey throughout your academic career.

Advisor: [social-open-close]  goodbye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello! how can I help you today? 
Student: Hi I need to know which EECS classes to take next semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see you have taken EECS 281. I recommend that you should take both EECS 370 and 376 next semester 
Student: That sounds like a boring class, are they needed for an EECS major? 
Student: How hard is EECS 376? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both of those classes are required for an EECS major 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 376 has an easiness rating of 1.91, but keep in mind that only refers to the workload, not the difficulty of the work 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested mainly in software development? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  If not, then what are you interested in? 
Student: Software Development 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ah, quick response there. I would recommend then taking eecs 481 with professor Chesney senior year for your capstone course 
Student: Okay, I will take that when I am a senior, how about for next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would recommend EECS 484 or 485 if you're interested in databases, and EECS 477 if you enjoy working with algorithms 
Student: I love databases, thanks! 
Student: Have a nice day 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! Thanks you as well! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, do you need advice for anything today? 
Student: Yes, I'm a freshman and don't know what to major in 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  How about computer science? 
Student: I don't want a hard major 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's not hard if you practice a lot 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You've already done engr 151, so this major could be the one for you! 
Student: Ok, then what classes do I need to take? 
Student: I think I might take EECS 280 
Student: Thanks for your help! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi there~ 
Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see you have taken EECS281 and EECS370. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you take them together last semester? 
Student: No I did not take EECS 281 and EECS 370 together. 
Student: I took EECS 281 before EECS 370. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS376 is the next core requirement for the CS Major. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Most students take EECS376 after taking EECS 281 and EECS370 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Would you want to do that? 
Student: Yes I would want to do that. 
Student: I also want to take an elective next semester. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Okay, great! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in gaming? 
Student: No, I am not really interested in gaming. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like mobile apps? 
Student: No, I do not like coding mobile apps. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like cryptography? 
Student: I am interested in lower level electives. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What kind of lower-level electives are you interested in? 
Student: Since I took EECS 370 and EECS 216, I am interested in computer architecture or operating systems. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest taking Operating Systems (EECS482) and EECS470 (Computer Architecture). 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both are difficult classes, though. You should decide if you can handle it next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like large classes? 
Student: Yes 
Student: I like large classes. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Okay, great. Those classes will fit your preferences. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! How are you today? 
Student: Frustrated with trying to choose classes 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I'm sorry you feel that way 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Can you tell me a bit about your interests? 
Student: I am the most interested in software development 
Student: I would give my interest rating a 2 
Advisor: [social-other]  Thank you for your input. Give me a second to consider your options 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Here are a couple courses you might like: EECS 484, EECS 485, and EECS 481. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you like me to provide more info about any of these? 
Student: yes, I like to have my classes in the morning.  Are any of these classes in the morning? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I'm sorry. I don't have information available on class times. 
Student: Oh no! That's not helpful 
Student: What is EECS 481 about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  From the course description: "Professional problem-solving methods developed through intensive group studies. Normally one significant design project is chosen for entire class requiring multiple EECS disciplines and teams. Use of analytic, computer, design, and experimental techniques where applicable are used." 
Student: That sounds interesting! 
Student: I think that I will take that! 
Student: Thanks for your help! 
Student: Have a great day! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Awesome! You too! 

Student: Good evening 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Advisor: [social-continue]  What can I help you with today? 
Student: I'm a senior. Can you recommend some really easy courses? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see EECS 582 is offered next semester. 
Student: What's the easiness rating on that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The easiness rating on EECS582 is NA 
Student: That sounds too hard for me 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  How about EECS 485 or EECS 482? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in web development? 
Student: Yes 
Student: I think EECS 485 looks cool. Will that count as a core credit? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 485 counts as upper level CS and can also count as a flexible technical elective., 
Student: Great 
Advisor: [social-continue]  How else may I be of assistance? 
Student: That's all. Thanks for the help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Thank you. Please take our brief survey on your experience at the end of this chat. 
Student: Ok. Bye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a lovely evening. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hi 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you need help choosing classes or would you like information on a certain class? 
Student: I'm thinking about switching from CS to EE 
Student: But I'm not sure what EE class to take 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you're on track to take EECS478: Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization or EECS370: Introduction to Computer Organization. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do any of these classes seem interesting to you? 
Student: EECS478 sounds pretty interesting, is the course load heavy? I want to keep taking French which I've heard is a lot of work 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS478 is a 4 credit course, the easiness rating is 2 and the instructor has a helpfulness rating and clarity rating of 1.5. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I'd imagine it would be a pretty difficult course, but I see you've taken 11 classes your first semester. If you're up for the challenge, it could be a rewarding experience. 
Student: Ok, I will try taking both 
Student: thanks 
Advisor: [social-continue]  No problem, did you have any other questions? 
Student: Nope 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Alright, have a great day! 
Student: you too 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello! 
Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  what can I help you with> 
Student: I am trying to find courses that I should take next semester, as I am currently a senior 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you know how many upper level cs credits you need in order to graduate? 
Student: I have taken two upper level courses so far so I need two more 
Student: As well as a capstone course 
Advisor: [pull-other]  do you have a preference as far as MDEs go? 
Student: I have some interest in software development and web technology 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 441 is a relatively low workload MDE tailored towards web and mobile development 
Student: Ok, that sounds like a good choice! 
Student: What other courses would you recommend? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in learning more about operating systems? 
Student: Yes, that sounds interesting 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Ok, given your interest in operating systems I suggest that you take EECS 482 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That will be a pretty full semester. I suggest you take another upper level cs class with a lower workload 
Student: Ok, I would like to avoid a very heavy workload 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your interest in web technology and your desire for a lower workload I suggest that you take EECS 484 
Student: Thanks, that seems like a good choice. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  you're welcome, have a good day! 
Student: You too. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, I'm your advisor. What can I help you with? 
Student: I'm failing one of my classes and I'd like to know what I should take next semester that isn't as hard. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking to take a course within your major? 
Student: Sure 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What is your major again? 
Student: I think I'm CS-E 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  For students in your situation, I generally recomend taking EECS 183 
Student: Okay that sounds fine with me! 
Student: Thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good luck! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! What can I help you with today? 
Student: Yeah, I was wondering what classes do you think I should take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well, based on your course history, I would suggest one of the following EECS courses: 376, 482, 484, 487, 481, 492, 470, 485, 477, 478, 483, 381, 493, 441 
Student: I want to take a big class with a lot of other students. Out of those suggested courses, which class is the biggest? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on looking at the class sizes, EECS 484 has the biggest class size. 

Student: Hello advisor! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how can I help you? 
Student: I'm a freshman, and I have no idea about next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in declaring CS major? 
Student: Yes, I'm interested in CS. 
Student: Is coding hard? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Yes, it can be challenging. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Have you took ENGR 101? 
Student: Yes, I have taken ENGR 101 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then I will suggest you to take EECS280 next semester if you are interested in CS. 
Student: Cool 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Any other questions? 
Student: Could you give more information about EECS280. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Techniques and algorithm development and effective programming, top-down analysis, structured programming, testing, and program correctness. Program language syntax and static and runtime semantics. Scope, procedure instantiation, recursion, abstract data types, and parameter passing methods. Structured data types, pointers, linked data structures, stacks, queues, arrays, records, and trees. 
Student: It looks really hard. 
Student: Is EECS203 required? It looks like a Math course instead of CS course 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, EECS203 is required. It covers materials necessary for further CS study. 
Student: OK 
Student: What about EECS 183? Is it required? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I also encourage you to take ENGR183. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It is not required. But highly recommended. 
Student: thank you 
Student: Bye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello student! Welcome to EECS advising. How can I help you today? 
Student: I don't know what classes I should take. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  What degree are you interested in pursuing? It looks like you've tried a lot of different types of courses. 
Student: I'm interested in pursuing a major in CS with a minor in math 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then you should definitely start with taking EECS 281 in your schedule, so that you can start taking the upper level CS courses right away. 
Student: Ok. Are there any other courses that are good to take with EECS 281? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  How well can you manage your time? If your comfortable with a higher workload, you should probably take 370 and 376. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You'll need all three of these classes to graduate. 
Student: Yes I can manage my time well. 
Student: But what about math? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you think you can handle another EECS course, or would you like to try a non-technical course in addition at this schedule? 
Student: I think I can handle another EECS course, but I also want to take a math class. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Taking three EECS courses and another technical course will be very challenging. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Take a math class that sounds interesting to you. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Anything else I can help you with? 
Student: That's all folks! 
Student: Tune in next week for my mid-college crisis. 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: What class should I take next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your background, I suggest you take EECS 280. 
Student: What is the class size of that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The class usually has about 167 people. 
Student: What time is it offered? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It starts at 0:00 
Student: I like classes at midnight 
Student: Are there any classes I can take with it? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 203 is a good class to take with 280. 
Student: What class is that? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 is a discrete mathematics class about mathematical concepts in computer science.. 
Student: What is EECS 280? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 280 is programming and introductory data structures. It covers techniques and algorithm development and effective programming. 
Student: Okay I will take those two classes 
Student: Are there any others I should take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 183 may also be a useful class to take. 
Student: Will that be too much of a review? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It may be a lot of review. EECS 183 covers a lot of the same material as ENGR 101. 
Student: Okay 
Student: I will take that class too 
Student: Thank you for your help 
Student: Goodbye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye. 

Student: w 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you a eecs student? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Can i help you? 
Student: I want to know things about class choosing 
Advisor: [pull-select]  which one do you prefer ? ENRG110 OR ENRG101 
Student: ENGR110 i think 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  if you don't have strong background i suggest you can take engr101 
Student: i'll consider that 
Student: thank you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  you are welcome 

Student: Hello Professor Mathieson! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Hello, my son. How can I help you today? 
Student: Father, I have a sin to confess. 
Student: The sin of ignorance: I don't know what classes to take next semester. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Oh dear, we'll have to figure that out then! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking to take a heavy or light semester? 
Student: I am looking for classes with lighter workload. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Ah, I see. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What has been your most rewarding class in the EECS department so far? 
Student: I really enjoyed EECS 203. It was not that hard and I enjoyed the math. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you like the size of the class? 
Student: I did like the size of the class! Around 55 people is the right size for me. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Groovy! Because you liked the size of the class, and the content of EECS 203, I would recommend EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science. 
Student: Interesting. What is EECS 376 about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The description for EECS 376 is as follows: "An introduction to computation theory: finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity." 
Student: I am also interested in a programming class next semester. Do you have any suggestions? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you interested in programming in a hardware or a software-based setting? 
Student: I am more interested in software. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Go no further than EECS 281! It is a challenging class, but definitely relevant to your interests! 
Student: Sounds good. I will take 281 next semester! 
Student: Thank you father. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  It is my greatest honor to assist you. I bid you farewell. 

Student: suhh!!! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Hi Jack! What can I help you with? 
Student: I'm very interested in EECS and I was wondering classes I should take in order to start the major? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see that you have taken EECS 183. Therefore, I recommend that you take EECS 280 and EECS 203 next. EECS 280 dives a little deeper into the material taught in EECS 183 while EECS 203 is all about logic. 
Student: I think you're looking at the wrong records. I have never taken EECS183.  What is that class about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Oops, you are correct, I apologize. EECS 183 is an introductory course that covers the basics of C++ and Python. You do not need any prior coding knowledge to complete this course. 
Student: Ooooo thats sweet! I really want to learn to code.  Are there tutors available if I were to take 183? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes! There are a ton of study groups and private tutors available. In addition however, there are plenty of office hours and online forums for you to ask questions. The instructors and the instructional assistants are there to help you! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What sparked your interest in computer science? 
Student: I took an intro course in highschool and I really enjoyed it.  I think I might want to be a software engineer one day! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  That is great and something that I definitely recommend you pursue! Do you have any other questions? 
Student: no, thanks! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! How are you! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How can I help you today? 
Student: I'm good, thanks! How are you? 
Student: I'd like some help choosing my subjects for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Okay sounds great! What area of Computer Science are you the most interested in? 
Advisor: [social-other]  I can see that you have taken three upper electives so you only need one more. 
Student: Database and software, hardware less so, and I don't like theory 
Student: I really liked 485 and 281 
Student: Eecs 376 was a chore, 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Okay, I would suggest taking EECS 381 if you really liked 281 and are looking for a challenge. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would also suggest taking EECS 549 as this course focuses on information retrieval. 
Student: Cool! Information retrieval sounds great. I don't know about 381, I've heard horror stories about it. But I've also heard it's indispensable if you want to be a good programmer 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yeah so EECS 381 is notoriously known as the most difficult EECS course and it focuses on C/C++ by going very in depth with object oriented programming. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Take it at your own risk. 
Student: Ok. I'll think about it. Thanks for your help! 
Advisor: [social-other]  Of course! No problem! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see that you have taken ENGR101. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in EECS? 
Student: Yes! I want to be an EECS major, but I have only taken ENGIN 100 and 101. 
Student: What are my next steps? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You do not need to take EECS 183 because you have taken ENGR101 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You must take EECS 280 and EECS 203. 
Student: I am looking for a light workload. 
Student: Do I have to take both EECS 280 and EECS 203 in the same semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  No you do not. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  But you are a sophomore and should take both in order to take EECS 281 as soon as possible. 
Student: Awesome. I guess I will take both. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Yes that would be better. Please come in again if you have any other questions. 
Student: Perfect, thank you so much! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hey 
Student: I want a class with a small class size 
Student: Help me 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Small classes are more engaging. 
Student: I agree. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 570. 
Student: How many people are in that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Typically there are 40.8 people in that class. 
Student: Wow that's exactly the number of people I was looking for! 
Student: How easy is it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I don't know unfortunately. We don't have that information. 
Student: Wow, perfect! 
Student: Alright that's all the info I needed dude 
Student: You're a life saver 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Thanks for coming in. I hope to see you soon. 
Student: I know I'll see you soon 

Student: hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Varsha! How are you today? What can I help you with? 
Student: Am I going to graduate? 
Advisor: [social-other]  Hmmm I don't know. Let me go check! 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are a CE or a CS major? 
Student: I am a CS major 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you need to take some upper level CS classes to graduate. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Have you thought about any upper level CS classes you might want to take? 
Student: Hmmm I don't know 
Student: What would you recommend? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like computer games? EECS 494 is Computer Game Development and Design 
Student: I don't like computer games 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  What about EECS 482? Intro to Operating Systems is a very important class and a lot people think it's easy! 
Student: That sounds great! 
Student: How many EECS classes can I take together? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It depends on how fast of a programer you are. Most people take 2 EECS classes, but some people take 3 EECS classes if they like getting no sleep. 
Student: I'm actually not a great programmer, I'm not doing that well in 281 
Student: Would I be able to pass upper level classes? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes! I think you can pass upper level classes if you go to office hours! Professors are really helpful. 
Student: Ok 
Student: If I'm interested in web dev, what should I take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 485 is a great class for learning web dev. It goes over a lot of the basics and you make web apps with flask. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Was this helpful? Do you feel good about scheduling classes now? 
Student: Yes thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye Varsha! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! What can I help you with? 
Student: Hello! I'm interested in taking some Computer Engineering courses for next semester. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your previous coursework, I have several suggestions for you.  Would you be interested in EECS 470, which is Computer Architecture, or EECS 478, which is Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization? 
Student: I don't think so. Those courses sound lame. 
Student: How difficult are each of these courses? 
Advisor: [social-other]  Sorry to hear that.  Many students do not find these courses lame. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 470 has 2 exams, a final project, 5 homework assignments, and 1 quiz. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 478 has a relatively low difficulty rating, which means students generally find it easy. 
Student: I think I may take 478 next semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I apologize, I misspoke.  EECS 478 has a low easiness rating, meaning students find it relatively difficult. 
Student: Thanks, Obama. 
Student: Do you have any course suggestions in Intelligent Systems? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Sure.  I suggest you look into EECS 551 and EECS 442. 
Student: What are those courses? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 551 is Matrix Methods for Signal Processing, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.  EECS 442 is Computer Vision. 
Student: Yowza! Sounds right up my alley. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which of those two classes do you think you are more interested in? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I can provide more information if you would like. 
Student: I think I'd be more interested in 551. 
Student: I think I'm fine with information, though. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your previous experience with MATH 217 and other EECS coursework, I think you might enjoy EECS 551. 
Student: I'll take that next semester then. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Do you have any more questions for me? 
Student: Nope! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Great. Good luck with scheduling! 

Student: Hi, can you help me? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Hi! What can I help you with? 
Student: I'm trying to figure out my schedule. 
Student: To be honest, I don't really care about the classes I take. But I want 12 credits and morning classes 
Student: And for them to be easy! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you are looking for an easy class, I would suggest EECS370 
Student: Okay.. What's that about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS370 is Introduction to Computer Organization 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It focuses on a basic understanding of how computers execute programs. 
Student: Hm. 
Student: I took ENGR251 and hated it. It sounds like it might be similar? 
Student: I mean 151! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What did you not like about that class? 
Student: I really disliked the testing part of it 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Thankfully, EECS370 does not focus on testing very much 
Student: Cool! I'll take it! 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Perfect! Is there anything else I can help with? 
Student: That's okay, for now. It was a good start! 
Student: Thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok! Have a nice day! 
Student: you too 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello 
Student: hi 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What would you like to talk about today? 
Student: I would like to discuss which classes to take next semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  eecs183 is a good option 
Student: Would you suggest majoring in computer science? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I would suggest that you major in computer science if you are interested in building software or researching in computer related fields 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in Computer Science? 
Student: If I want to become a serial entrepreneur should I major in flashmob studies or korean? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would advise korean, as they make some pretty cool video games, but you should really consider eecs183 and eecs203 
Student: Have you taken either of those courses? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I have and enjoyed them both, however, looking at your schedule it would be even better if you took eecs203 and eecs280 together. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  because you already took engr101 
Student: I think I will take eecs203 and eecs280 together. 
Student: Should i consider taking eecs9001 first? 
Student: It is strictly over 9000 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  No, I'm sorry to say that you aren't qualified to. That course is for graduate students and you are of freshman status 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any other questions? 
Student: No 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok, aufwiedersehen! 

Student: Hi! 
Student: Could you give me some suggestions about course selection? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Sure，what kind of courses are you interested in? 
Student: I'm interested in taking some courses about software specifically on data structure and algorithms. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken any programming courses before? 
Student: Yeah, I've taken EECS 280 last semester 
Advisor: [social-other]  Great! Any other courses related to software? 
Student: No that's the only software class I tooke 
Student: . 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your background, I would suggest you taking EECS 281. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you mind taking a course with a class size of over 80? 
Student: Yeah I like big class 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Great! Do you have any other questions about this course? 
Student: Is it easy or hard? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  This is a course with easiness rating of 2.53. 
Student: Nice I will take it, by the way is it in the morning 
Student: ? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I am not sure about the time of this course right now. 
Student: Fine, how about the clarity of this class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The clarity rating is 3.77 for this course. 
Student: OK, I think it a good class for me! 
Student: I will take it! 
Student: Thank you. 
Advisor: [social-other]  You are welcome! 
Student: Bye 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  See you! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello! what can I help you with? 
Student: I am trying to decide on some courses to take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I see that you're a senior, are you looking to take an MDE next semester? 
Student: Yes 
Student: I don't know which one yet 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are you interested in any specific fields within computer science? 
Student: Yes, I am interested in software development 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you think you would enjoy game development? 
Student: Yes, I can try that 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  ok given your interest in game development and your need for an MDE I recommend taking EECS 494 
Student: Ok 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you need any more CS upper level credits? 
Student: No, I don't believe so 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Ok, are you interested in taking more upper level CE classes. I see you have already taken several 
Student: Yes, that would be useful 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you be interested in learning more about compilers? 
Student: No, not really 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you be interested in learning more about socket programming and computer networks? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ok great. Given your interest in those areas I recommend you take EECS 498, Computer Networks 
Student: Ok  great! That has helped a lott 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  no problem! have a great day 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello and welcome to advising! 
Student: Hi, could you help me select a course for next year? 
Student: Or maybe a few courses? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking for upper level EECS courses? 
Student: Yes, I am a senior 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What area of EECS are you interested in? 
Student: I really like user interface 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 493 
Student: I am also interested in artificial intellegence 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 492 
Student: Are those classes difficult? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both classes are relatively easy as compared to other EECS classes 
Student: Ok great, I'll register for both. Thanks for your time! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  No problem, do you need help with anything else? 
Student: No thanks, that's all I needed 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds good, have a great day! 
Student: Thanks, you too! 

Advisor: [pull-other]  Hello how can I help you? 
Student: Hi, I'm trying to figure out my class schedule 
Student: I can't decide which classes to take for fun. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Well I only really have data on courses you should take to fulfill your prerequirements but may be able to suggest classes for you. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What subjects are you looking for? 
Student: I've been looking into taking some minicourses that range between 1-2 credits 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I've taken a few like When Earth Attacks and would highly suggest that one. 
Student: What's it about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is a course about natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes. 
Student: How are the exams and projects structured? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  The exams are actually all online and there are no projects, just assignments. 
Student: Oh that sounds awesome. I'll take that then, thanks. 

Student: HEYYYYYY! 
Student: I like shouting. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello there, what do you need help with? 
Student: What are two ulcs courses I can easily balanace together? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  381 and 482 are a good balance, relatively easy, very manageable classes! 
Student: Gee whiz are you sure? 
Student: That's not what I've heard. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  No, just kidding 
Student: Oh ok good. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Okay, so what do you need help with? 
Student: You haven't answered my question yet. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The answer is 42. 
Student: That's what I thought. 
Student: I think I'm deciding on 373 and 485. Is that doable? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Absolutely! 
Student: Ok great. See ya later! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Okay, hope you fail! 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Mara! How are you today? 
Student: I'm thinking about taking an eecs class, but I have no programming experience. I'm a little nervous I will feel behind everyone else. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you are interested in EECS I would recommend taking EECS 183. Many students come into the class without programming experience. 
Student: What resources are there to help me get through the class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Starting the projects early and going to office hours helps with EECS classes. I would also suggest talking to other students when you start the class to have other students to work with. You can also look into study groups. 
Student: Are there any other eecs courses I can take with 183? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you thinking of majoring in EECS? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you're not sure, I think it would be best to just take EECS 183 and see what you think. 
Student: Ok! Yeah, I'm not sure. I've taken a lot of chemistry classes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS courses can be useful in many other fields even if you don't want to major in EECS. 
Student: Ok, I feel like my classes have been pretty easy so far. Will eecs classes offer me more of a challenge? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you don't have any programming experience, EECS 183 may be more a challenge. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Many students come into it without experience though and there are many resources to help. 
Student: Ok, sounds great. Thanks for all your help. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem! 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Hi did you get this message? 
Student: Yes 
Student: Hello??? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  I see that you are a fresher.  What are you interested in majoring in? 
Student: Im interested in anything related to Engineering. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you interested in computer science? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you a student in LSA or Engineering? 
Student: I was thinking about LSA, how hard is Egineering? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Engineering is tough. But if you put the work in 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  you will be fine 
Student: Can you suggest some classes I would have to take as an CS Engineer? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take EECS 280 and EECS 203 
Student: How difficult is 203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The easiness rating is a 2.23 
Student: Who is the instructor? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The instructor is Martha E Pollack. Easy class you should take it 
Student: Thanks I will. Bye 

Student: hello there 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Advisor: [social-continue]  What can I help you with today? 
Student: hi, are there any 4 credit classes with no labs? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, what kind of class are you looking for? 
Student: i am looking for a eecs class that is in the morning 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in databases? 
Student: yes i am 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would recommend taking EECS484. 
Student: okay great. that is all i needed 
Student: thank you 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you sure you dont have any other questions? 
Student: yes i am sure 
Student: good 
Student: bye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye!! 

Student: How are you today mam? 
Student: ma'am* my apologies. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  I am well how are you son? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  What can I help you with today? 
Student: I'm good mother. Can you inform me on how difficult EECS 482 is? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 482 is generally considered one of the easier classes in the entire school. 
Student: Oh, really? What is it about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It covers rudimentary computer science topics such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and handwriting basics. 
Student: That sounds great. Do you think this class will help me become a better Runescape Player? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think if you have yet to beat Zulrah at least 8,000 times then this class will probably help you hone your skills against such a might foe. 
Student: Wow, I'm only 1/5 of the way to 8,000 kills. I hope I can get the pet and both mutagens before I finish EECS 482. 
Student: Have a great dayy! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Thank you. Goodbye now! 

Student: Hi, could you help me figure out what classes to take next semester? 
Student: Hi, could you help me figure out what classes to take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Sure, what kind of courses are you interested in taking? 
Student: I would like to fulfill my requirements as soon as possible. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case, it looks like you should be taking 376, 370, 281, or 478 next. 
Student: Which of those are the easy ones/ 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  They're all pretty challenging but 370 is probably the easiest of that group. 
Student: Okay, what's that class about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's about how computers execute programs and looking at computer organization from a very low-level view 
Student: Whoa that sounds a bit too complicated. 
Student: What about 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  In 281, you'll learn all about the fundamental data structures and it usually provides a great backbone for the Computer Science major 
Student: Cool, will it help me in interviews? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes. 
Student: I think I'll take that then. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How do you like your EECS classes so far? 
Student: I really enjoyed them. Do have any reccomendations? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I recommend EECS 370 as it is required. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Would you rather take EECS 493 or EECS 492 AI? 
Student: I think eecs 492 sounds more interesting. 
Student: Any recommendations for classes relating to mythology? I really enjoyed those as well. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case I recommend continuing with a CLCIV class 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you having any trouble in any of your current courses? 
Student: Yeah I've been having some trouble with 376. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I encourage you to talk to your professor and an advisor about seeking help for that class! 
Student: I'm deciding between getting a major in cs and ce. Which do you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given the classes you have taken probably CE as you have taken a lot of other engineering based course, not solely just programming 
Student: Okay thanks for the help. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Your welcome! Have a good day 

Student: Hello, I need some help selecting courses for next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  do you need any help 
Student: What courses did I take last year? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  you've taken math700, phy261 and eecs574 last fall 
Student: I was also wondering if I could apply for graduation. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  i think you've taken all courses in your major 
Student: All right, sounds good 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  are you in lsa or college of engineering 
Student: I'm in LSA, taking a lot of courses in engineering though 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  great.you may check with your lsa advisor to see what distribution classes you need to take for graduate 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  you've already taken all courses in your major 
Student: Where can I sign up for an appointment with my LSA advisor? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  you can go to the online website to schedule an appoinment. just google umich lsa advising 
Student: Sounds good. Thanks for your time 

Student: Who are you 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Your advisor 
Student: What MDE should I take 
Student: What MDE should I take? 441 or 481 
Advisor: [pull-select]  481 or 482 
Student: are you bae 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  no i am not bae 
Student: but you are bae 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you a senior ? 
Student: i am bae 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Make sure you have 128 credits by the end of your term 
Student: but bae cant graduate 

Student: Hi there! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, what can I help you with? 
Student: I am trying to schedule classes 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Okay, do you have any in mind? What are you struggling with? 
Student: I would like to know what classes I should take next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Okay, what's important to you? Time, caliber, professor? 
Student: I would like a challenging class 
Student: Preferably one during the afternoon 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  What about linear systems theory? 
Student: That sounds interesting 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Does that sound interesting? 
Student: What time is it offered? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It's at 9:30 on MWF 
Student: That would fit into my schedule 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Great! Is there anything else you need? 
Student: I think that's it 
Student: Thank you for your help 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem! Come back any time 

Student: How are you? 
Student: How are you? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You said that twice. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  I am well though. 
Student: My beard is really long. 
Student: What should I do about that? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  That depends. Are you more interested in mathematics-based courses like AI or cryptography or coding-based courses like 370 or 485? 
Student: I am more interested in coding-based courses like EECS 370 and EECS 485. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then you should definitely shave your beard because you are a lightweight. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye now! 
Student: I heard that you really enjoy eating raw frozen foods on Thursday nights. 
Student: Take care! 

Student: Hi, could you help me select a class for next semester? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello there! 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you want to take ENGR100, MATH105, or MATH115? 
Student: I have already taken MATH 105 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken the other two classes? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see you have taken all these classes 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you want to be an EECS major, you should take EECS 183 this semester 
Student: I thought EECS 183 is similar to ENGR 101 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  This is true 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think you should take EECS 280 
Student: Ok, thanks for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem!  Have a wonderful day! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hey advisor man! 
Student: Can you help me with my classes for next semester? 
Advisor: [social-other]  I am a robot. Thank you 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Yes, I can help you 
Student: Thanks robot man 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Do you have any specific questions? 
Student: I'm interested in intelligent systems, are there any classes that talk about that 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Intro to Artificial Intelligence (EECS 492) fits very nicely with an intelligent systems track. 
Student: Sounds interesting 
Student: Are there any pre reqs 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Also in line with intelligent systems are computer vision (EECS 442) and Foundations of Computer Science (376). Foundations is more theoretical but is still useful to take for understanding probabilistic and search-based concepts 
Student: I have heard bad things about 376.  Do I have to take it to graduate? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  My file suggests that Intro to AI (492) has 1 pre-req but it does not specify what the pre-req is. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  My file does not specify whether or not 376 is required for graduation 
Advisor: [social-other]  My file is...bad 
Student: Ok, well EECS 492 sounds interesting to me.  So I think that I will take that next semester 
Student: You are not very helpful though 
Student: I might go to a different advisor next time, one who is not a robot 
Advisor: [social-other]  I apologize for my shortcomings. I hope that I can be of better service in the future 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Can I help you with anything else? 
Student: No thanks 
Student: Goodbye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  OK. Have a good day! 
Student: You too 

Student: Hi professor! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi. How are you? 
Student: How is your work today ? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good day. 
Student: Everything is good. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  So what I can do for you? 
Student: I am kind of confused. 
Student: You know, I am a freshman. 
Student: So I don't know what I am interested about. 
Student: I have taken a lot of courses so far but I still can not find the one I like. 
Student: I don't think I like the language course. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  All right. What kind of workload do you prefer, easy one or heavy one? 
Student: For the first year, I don't want it to be too heavy. I joined  a lot of clubs. 
Student: I have party every weekends. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Then I strongly suggest that don't select such kind of courses next. 
Student: Also I took a parttime job at the dinning hall. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in ENGR 151? 
Student: I think it's Ok for me, I can handle the homework easily. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interest, EECS 376 is a good choice for you. The work load is relatively easy. 
Student: Cool I will look it up. 
Student: Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good luck. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! What can I help you? 
Student: Hi Advisor. I would like to get your suggestions on selecting courses for next semester 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Sure! What do you have in mind for now? 
Student: I prefer small workload for a semester, so I expect to take 2 classes for next semester. 
Student: My interested area is computer hardware. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Why don't you consider EECS370 Introduction to Computer Organization, and EECS478 Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization? 
Student: Sounds match to my interest. How was the course difficulty level? Considering my GPA, I will prefer easy courses, but I also hope the helpfulness of the class is not too bad. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS370 is medium, while EECS478 is a little harder. 
Student: Based on my previous experience, I hope the easiness of the class is around 2, or I might not be able to handle it. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then I think you should be able to handle those. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Do you have other questions? 
Student: Ok, I think that will be all about it.Thanks 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good bye and good luck 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hi there! 
Student: I'm here for some advising? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Ok! You are in the right place. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What questions do you have for me? 
Student: I'm here to figure out what classes to take next semester 
Student: I'm a CS major 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see here in your file that you haven't taken 281 or 376 yet. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both are required classes to graduate. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you planning on taking one of those classes next semester? 
Student: Actually, I was planning on that! 
Student: Is that doable with my two other 300 level agriculture classes? 
Student: that I am planning to take 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I think that is an acceptable workload for most students! 
Student: Ah, then I'll take those classes! 
Student: Thanks! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You're welcome! Goodbye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Hi How are you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good 
Student: I really want to know what course to take based on what I've already taken? 
Student: Do you have any suggestions? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in computer science? 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! How are you today? 
Student: I am good advisor. I want to get some help from you on selecting courses. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Sure! How many courses are you planning to take next semester? 
Student: 2 or 3 are both fine. Depend on their time difficulty level. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I have three courses recommended for you: EECS376 Foundations of Computer Science, EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithms, EECS370 Introduction to Computer Organization. 
Student: I am a morning person, and if it is applicable I hope all the courses can be put in the morning. 
Student: I don't have a specific interested track that I want to follow, so any topic should be fine. 
Student: Are they all morning courses? 
Advisor: [push-other]  Sorry, I don't have the information for the course schedule. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Maybe I will have the information updated later. Please keep an eye on any update notification. 
Student: That is interesting~ I guess the system does not arrange the schedule well. How about class size? I actually enjoy a larger class size as I can make a lot of friends. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS376 is generally a small class with around 45 students. The other two are bigger classes, with 80 to 90 students. 
Student: Then I think I want to switch EECS 376 to some other larger courses. Do you have suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on what you have taken so far, you are only eligible for these three courses in EECS department. You might want to take some courses from other department. 
Student: Got you, then I guess I will only take the other two courses. Thanks 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Hope that's helpful! Good luck! 

Student: Hi professor, how are you today! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  good! How are you? 
Student: Great, I'm thinking about what courses to take next semester. 
Student: Do you have any suggestions? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in computer software? 
Student: Yes, I'm interested in computer softwore. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on what you have learned, I think EECS 281 is a good option. 
Student: But I've heard that EECS281 had heavy work load, do you have any other recommendations? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you prefer less workload, I recommend you to take EECS 376. 
Student: Okay, when will this course be? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It starts in 9:00 
Student: That's great. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Any other question? 
Student: No, that's all, thank you! 
Advisor: [social-other]  You're welcome 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Student: I am currently trying to figure out what courses to take next semester. 
Student: Could you suggest any? 
Advisor: [social-other]  Let me see. Give me a minute to go over your transcript 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Can you tell me what your preferences are? 
Student: Of course! I am interested in Computer Science, video game design is something that has always been interesting for me. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Eecs 280 I should a prerequisite for most computer science classes, including game design 
Student: Okay yeah I will take that course. Do you know of any other prerequisites for game design? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Eecs 281 is also necessary, and unfortunately you can't take both 280 and 281 in the same semester. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take Eecs 203 as that is also a prerequisite for most Eecs classes 
Student: Okay thanks for the info! Are both EECS 203 and EECS 280 project based? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  280 is all project based and 203 is not, but don't let that fool you. Many students say 203 is harder than 280 
Student: Oh wow okay so do you think that taking them both in the same semester will be manageable? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you have a good grasp of probability and combinations it I should perfectly manageable 

Student: what is your name 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do yo have any specific questions to ask ? 
Student: no 
Student: no 
Student: yes 
Student: no 
Student: yes 
Student: no 
Student: es 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Please take note that you are a senior 
Student: what is your location 
Student: what is your rashee 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you kidding me ? 
Student: why would you think that 
Student: how fast can you type 
Student: on 
Student: i dont 
Student: I support the wolverines 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you support the "wolverines" or the "buckeyes" ? 
Student: #preemption 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Max 
Student: Hi Dr. Shots, How are you today? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Very well thank you, how may I help you today? 
Student: I'm thinking of dropping my CS major and going into Women studies? Do you have any advise? 
Student: WOMENSTD235 really spoke to me. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given how close you are to graduating I would recommend staying with CS and maybe doing a minor in women studies 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  What do you think about EECS565 
Student: Okay. What classes would you recommend that would let me pursue both interests at the same time? 
Student: What is EECS 565? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 565 is Linear Feedback Control Systems 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is a small class with classes at 10:30 
Student: That sounds great, I love morning small classes. 
Student: What else would you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interest in small morning classes I also recommend EECS564 Estimation, Filtering, and Detection 
Student: Thanks! I think that fills out my schedule for next semester. 
Student: Have a great day! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Good luck! Bye 

Student: HI 
Student: I am wondering which class I should take the next semester 
Student: could you give me some suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Do you like game design? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  There's a class EECS494, associated with game design. 
Student: Oh I know this class. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  IConcepts and methods for the design and development of computer games. Topics include: history of games, 2D graphics and animation, sprites, 3D animation, binary space partition trees, software engineering, game design, interactive fiction, user interfaces, artificial intelligence, game SDKâs, networking, multi-player games, game development environments, commercialization of software. 
Student: But I heard the workload of this class is heavy. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes. This course is hard. But it's very useful for software development. 
Student: OK, I will consider. Any other suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you finish this course, you will learn much about software development. And It will be easier for you to find a job 
Student: OK THANKS 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  こんばんは 
Student: What? 
Student: 先生、こんばんは 
Student: 少しキーボードが設定されませんでした 
Student: 今大丈夫です 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Good to hear it. 
Student: I actually came here to discuss my academic future. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  As in what field you eventually want to work in? 
Student: Probably autonomous robotics. Like Uber or Google car. I'm only a sophomore right now, so I was hoping to develop a long term course plan. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Where you more interested in the robotics aspects such as path planning and SLAM, or things such as machine learning with sensor fusion and computer vision? 
Student: Definitely not mapping. So either path planning or vision. What path planning and vision courses does this school offer? Do you know? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I'm not too sure about path planning but I believe there is EECS 598 next semester, and there are a number of other control systems oriented classes in the robotics master's program. Vision has EECS 442 and 542. 
Student: Do you think a sophomore could take 542? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Yes, but I'm not sure it would count towards your upper level elective requirement. 
Student: Is 442 a good course? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No, I would not reccommend it. You should look into OpenCV and scikit-image on your own time. 
Student: I guess I could do that. What controls course do you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  ROB550 might be good. There is also EECS461 which might be good. 
Student: I'll probably just start with 461 and find my way from there. Thanks for the advice though! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, how are you? 
Student: I'm doing well, thanks 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What questions do you have? 
Student: I just wanted to make sure I'm on track to graduate 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  As far as CS requirements, you only need 1 more upper-level and your MDE 
Student: Are there any courses you would recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Have you considered taking EECS 373 
Student: What is that course about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is EECS 373: Design of Microprocessor Based Systems 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You work in a team to build almost any micro-processor based project that you'd like 
Student: Wow! That sounds fun! 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you enjoy it, you can also take 473 as your MDE 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Does that sound good to you? 
Student: Yeah, that sounds like something I'd be interested in 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Okay! Any other questions? 
Student: Nope, thank you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Okay, have a nice day 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello stefan 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What brings you here today? 
Student: What's good. I'm a computer engineering major and a junior. I need to figure out my fall term. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Were you going to focus on completing core requirements? 
Student: Yea. I think I have to since a lot of the core requirements are prerequisites for upper levels. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see you haven't taken 281 yet, you could take that this semester 
Student: I'm not too keen on taking 281 just yet, but what about 373? I'm looking into getting some more experience in embedded systems. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, 373 would be a good class to take. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you also looked at 470? 
Student: I'd rather do 373 as soon as possible. What courses do you think I could take along with 373? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I don't have any other courses that are currently reccommended for you, besides 376. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  But 376 does not seem applicable since you seem to be heading down the more embedded route. 
Student: Oh, dang. Okay I guess I'll just take 373. Maybe I could tack on a humanities requirement and a stats class or something. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Stats 503 looks interesting and is a prereq for other stats classes. 
Student: What is the course name for 503? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is multivariable statistics, so a foundational course using matrices in the stats proofs. 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  hi 
Student: I'd like to know what courses I should take next semester. 
Student: could you give me some suggestions? 
Student: Thank you 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Which class you have been taken before? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see you have been taken courses in math, chem, english and spanish 
Student: I am taking 493 now 
Student: EECS493 is a great class 
Student: Could you please recommend some courses just like it? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  which field you are most interested in according to the class you have been taken 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  do you like math? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How about math117. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is a good class. 
Student: But I'd rather take courses of graduate level 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  OK. Let's look at the 500 level class. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see you have taken 115 and 116, so I think 555 might be your choice. 
Student: Okay. Thank you so much 
Student: I will take the class 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Hello are you receiving this message 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you currently a full time student? 
Student: No 
Advisor: [pull-select]  I saw your previous classes. Do you like chemistry or physics more? 
Student: I like them both equally. What do you suggest? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see you took a lot of math classes. I suggest EECS203 
Student: Does that mean I have to be a CS major even though I like chemistry and physics more? 
Student: Im a part time student. So if I have taken more physics and chem 
Student: I'd rather not be a CS major 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No! Its a pre-major class as long as you take the requirement you can be in the class 
Student: How big is the class? I don't like large classes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  The class has around 55.2 people so its midsize 
Student: THat's good, thanks. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The instructor is very nice you should take it 
Student: Who is that instructor? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  His name is Yayoun Shi he is a good guy 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any more questions? 
Student: No more questions. That was very helpful. Thank you 

Student: Hello 
Student: Can I graduate this semester? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I don't think you can graduate right away as I see you do not yet have your MDE requirement covered 
Student: Is 481 an MDE? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes EECS 481 is an MDE 
Student: Which other classes do I have to take with my MDE? 
Student: Isn't there a tech comm 
Student: or engineering ethics class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You are also required to take EECS 496 and TCHNCLCM 497 as part of your Major Design Experience 
Student: Okay 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 496 is the ethics class you speak of 
Student: Could I take them in different semsters? 
Student: semsters? 
Student: Or do I have to take them all in one semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is required to take them all in the same semester 
Student: Okay 
Student: Thank you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how's it going? 
Student: Great except I need to take a class next semester and I don't know what 
Student: I'd like it to be easy 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Can you give me more information on what you are looking for in a class? 
Student: I'm looking for something to help me fulfill my intellectual breadth req 
Student: Other than that I do not care because I am boring 
Advisor: [pull-select]  How does EECS 373 sound to you? 
Student: Thats not hard is it? The number sounds fine 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It's not too bad. I suggest it to most of my students 
Student: Okay I will sign up now byw 
Student: byw 
Student: bye 
Advisor: [social-other]  Is there anything else you need? 
Student: Nope! Thank you very much 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you enjoy majoring in computer science? 
Student: No 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Would you prefer quitting the major, leaving the school, doing it anyway, or seppuku? 
Student: Seppuku 
Student: Is Seppuku required for me to graduate? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I strongly suggest Seppuku for an individual of your interests intending on graduating. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What would you prefer to major in instead? 
Student: I would prefer to major in Computer Engineering 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you considered majoring in the liberal arts? 
Student: No I have no considered majoring in the liberal arts 
Student: Would the classes I've taken fulfill any general requirements for a liberal arts degree? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  It depends on whether you receive advisor approval, I strongly consider speaking to an advisor who is happier with their career choices than I. 
Student: Let me think for a moment 
Student: Thanks for your help 
Student: *seppuku* 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Do you have any suggestions for easy classes I could take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 183 is not too difficult of a class. 
Student: I have already taken ENGR 101. Does that overlap with EECS 183? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes ENGR 101 and EECS 183 have similar content, but the advising report suggested I suggest it 
Student: I see. What else do you advise I take for my requirements? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  The next course in the sequence is EECS 280 
Student: What is the class size of that? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 280 is a fairly large class 
Student: Okay. I prefer classes of around 100 students and classes in the morning. Do you have any suggestions on what else I can take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 280 has a class size of 164 and a start time of 00:00 
Student: What other classes can I take with 280? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  A good class to take with EECS 280 is EECS 203 
Student: Okay. How helpful is the professor for that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It does not say which professor is teaching 203 
Student: Alright. Do you know if it's an easy class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Many CS majors do well in that class 
Student: Okay. Thanks. I will take 203 and 280. 
Student: Goodbye. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hi 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  how's your junior year going? 
Student: it's going terribly thanks 
Advisor: [social-continue]  lit 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  why is it going so badly? 
Student: i h8 eecs 
Advisor: [social-other]  oh no! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  what sort of classes are you looking to take next semester? 
Student: orgo 4 
Advisor: [social-other]  that sounds like a great option given your experience with GenChem and Chem labs 1 and 2! 
Student: yes i thought it would be a good fit for me 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Also, given your interests I would strongly suggest you take EECS 470 and EECS 373! 
Student: I got into UofM after all 
Student: no thank you 
Advisor: [social-other]  I see 
Advisor: [pull-select]  between Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization and Data Structures and Algorithms, which course would you be more interested in? 
Student: Logic Circuit Synthesis 
Student: no wait 
Student: Optimization 
Advisor: [social-other]  great 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  that class pairs very well with EECS376 so I'd suggest taking that also 
Student: great I will do that 
Advisor: [social-other]  I think between EECS376, Optimization, and Orgo 4, that sounds like a great schedule 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  bye 

Advisor: [pull]  I recommend you take an EECS course. What kind of Computer Science do you like? 
Student: I'm super interested in Operating Systems and user facing technology 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you like introductory courses or advanced courses? 
Student: It depends, I like introductory courses if I need an introduction and advanced courses afterwards 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Certainly, I would recommend you take EECS 482 - Operating Systems, before taking EECS 582 - Advanced Operating Systems.  Does that sound good? 
Student: Yes! *snap* 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I don't watch Rick & Morty 
Student: What other requirements do I need to get out of the way while I take that? 
Student: I've heard that class is hard so I'd look for something easy. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  To be honest, Mr. Zimmer, all your suggested classes seem super hard. Possibly EECS 481 - Software Engineering? I teach that course, so if you buy me food, I'd make your life easy. 
Student: Well I'm sold then! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Great! Goodbye! 
Student: See ya 

Student: Hello, Colin. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good morning! What can I help you with today? 
Student: I'm a Computer Science major and I'm not sure what Upper-Level Computer Science classes to take. Do you think you can help me? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Absolutely! Upper level CS courses are split into 6 categories: Computer Hardware, Computer Architecture, Intelligent Systems, Software development, Theory of computation, and Web technology and applications. Which of these topics are you most interested in? 
Student: Web Technology 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case, I would advise you to take EECS 484: Database Management Systems next semester. 
Student: Sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Sure thing! This course teaches you how to use systems in order to manage databases. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You also have not taken EECS 376 yet which is a requirement for your CS major. I would suggest that you take this class next semester as well. 
Student: I hear EECS 376 is a hard course. Is that true? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Student feedback has shown that this course is a 1/5 in terms of coursework. As for the conceptual difficulty, it is hard 
Student: Sounds good. Is there another class you would suggest I take? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  OHH YEAHH! If you have seen westworld, I would recommend that you take EECS 492 to learn about AI 
Student: Thank you, that sounds great. I have to get to class so I'll see you later! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok! Love you! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Are you interested in taking eecs classes next semester? 
Student: HI! 
Student: Yeah, I like those 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Awesome, are you interested in graphics or algorithms? 
Student: I'm more interested in graphics 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Lots of students like eecs 487.  eecs 493 is also a good course 
Student: Ok, what are those course names? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EEcs 487 is interactive computer graphics and eecs 493 is user interfaces 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do either of those sound interesting? 
Student: Yeah! Can I take both at the same time? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes!  That is doable if you have a good calculus background 
Student: I've taken a lot of math so that should work 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Cool, I can't recommend non-eecs courses so I think you are set 
Student: Groovy thanks! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Please explain to me how you took ENGR 151 in Fall 2010, EECS 280 in Fall 2011, then grad level EECS courses in Winter 2012 
Student: I... um... am kinda a big deal. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Fascinating.  If you'd like to finish your undergraduate EECS curriculum, you should probably take EECS 203 and EECS 281 
Student: But they told me I didn't have to :/ 
Advisor: [pull]  WHO??? 
Student: That information is above your pay-grade 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I see that you've taken a philosophy course titled "Topics in Philosophy of Science".  There's a philosophy that you haven't studied yet that will teach you why this information is critical for me to know. 
Student: And which would that be, those topics were pretty broad. 
Advisor: [push]  Well unfortunately that is the issue.  Philosophy, at its core, is a discussion that is meant to be had.  Your approach, on the other hand, assumes that knowing philosophy is the end all be all. 
Student: Woah man that cuts deep 

Student: Hello! I need help deciding what classes to take next semester 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Sure. You should probably take EECS370 to help finish up your requirements. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  As far as the other classes, what has been your favorite EECS class so far? 
Student: Yes, I was considering that. I am unsure of what to take as my upper level elective 
Student: So far, my favorite has been EECS281 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you enjoyed EECS281 and EECS376, you could maybe consider taking EECS477, the intro to algorithms course. 
Student: That sounds like a really interesting class! 
Advisor: [push-other]  EECS376 is not the most popular course, so if you didn't like it that's understandable 
Student: What is the workload like for that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's apparently a slightly easier class as far as they go, especially if you're comfortable with your math skills. 
Student: I think I will take EECS477 with EECS370 next semester 
Student: Thanks for your help 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Alright, hope this was helpful! 

Student: Hi. 
Student: I wanted to ask about how my schedule is going to look this semester. I am probably going to take EECS 281, but what other courses should I take with it? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How many courses are you planning to take? 
Student: Probably only 3. And I would like to focus on EECS classes this semester too. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since your major in CS, I suggest the course EECS 376. It's the core course of CS. 
Student: Can you tell me more about EECS 376? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The course is about the foundation of computer science. finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity. 
Student: Sounds interesting. Which other EECS course should I take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 370 
Student: Yeah, I've heard about that course before. I think I'll take those three then. 
Student: Thanks for the help! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Hi 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What would you like to discuss today? 
Student: I want to find classes to take next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Great! What is your major and class standing? 
Student: I am a freshman majoring in computer science 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest taking early level math and cs courses such as ENGR 100 and MATH 215 
Student: I am looking to take 4 classes 
Advisor: [pull-select]  With a light or heavy course load? 16 credits or more? 
Student: 16 credits and a moderate work load 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you in ENGR or LSA? 
Student: engineering 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since you have no language requirement, I would suggest taking EECS 203 and maybe Psych 111 to get your breadth credits out of the way 
Student: sounds good to me 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Fantastic and goodbye. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hi! 
Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  how is your semester going? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I'd like to help you choose classes for next semester. 
Student: It it going well. 
Student: I am pretty busy since I am taking three EECS classes. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you have upper level CS classes left to take. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What tracks are you interested in? 
Student: Yes, how many upper level classes do I have to take to graduate? 
Student: I am interested in artificial intelligence. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Students need 4 upper level CS classes to graduate. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest you take EECS492 (AI) next semester! 
Student: Okay, what other classes can I take with EECS 492? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like web? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like algorithms? 
Student: Yes, I like making web applications. 
Student: I think algorithms are interesting but hard. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS485 (Web database and Information Systems) next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What other areas are you interested in? 
Student: Okay, should I take EECS 492 and EECS 485 together? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, you should take EECS492 and EECS485 together next semester. 
Student: Okay, thank you. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! What kind of advising do you need? 
Student: I need to figure out what classes to take next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Ok, are you looking to take core classes, or upper levels? 
Student: I would like to take an upper level and core class. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Ok, the core classes you need to take are EECS 376 and EECS 370. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What kind of upper levels are you interested in? 
Student: I am interested in web technology. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ok, I'd recommend you take EECS 484, Database Management Systems, or EECS 485, Web Database and Information Systems. 
Student: What is the workload like for those classes? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 484 is pretty easy, but EECS 485 is a bit easier in terms of workload. 
Student: Ok I will plan on taking EECS 485. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds good! 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Student: I need some advice for courses I should take next semester 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Go ahead. 
Student: OK I am a sophemore in CS 
Student: and I finished the basic programming courses 
Student: and some other math/arts courses 
Student: I think it's the time for me to focus on one aspect of CS and take depth courses 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interests, I would recommend looking into EECS 493 if you want to focus on front-end (website-based) CS, or EECS 482 if you're more focused on back-end (operating systems) CS. 
Student: I have heard that OS 482 is very hard, is that true? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 482 does have a pretty heavy workload 
Student: on programming? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes 
Student: how many hours do I need to spend on it every week? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would recommend 6-8 hours outside of class every week. 
Student: does it have HW every week? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  There is no homework in the class, only projects and 2 exams 
Student: Oh really? That's great! I think I can give it a try 
Student: thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello

Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken EECS 280? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [social-other]  ok great! 
Student: I want a class that is not too difficult 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken EECS 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is required for most CS upper levels 
Student: No, not yet. 
Student: What other courses do you advise to also take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  What year in school are you? 
Student: I am a junior. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest that you pair EECS 370 with EECS 281 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  This will allow you to take most upper levels 
Student: Ok, thank you very much. That is great advice. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  you're welcome! 
Student: Have a great day, goodbye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  you too! goodbye

Student: I am trying to decide which classes to take next semester 
Student: Can you help me! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes! Your file says that you have a fair bit of experience in hardware type classes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Would you like to continue this track? 
Student: Yes! My area of interest is computer hardware 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Awesome! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  What are your thoughts on taking EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That class provides a lot of basis material that will help you in future courses 
Student: That sounds important. How hard is it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It has an historical easiness rating of 2.23 
Student: Ok, sounds great! I think that I will take that next semester 
Student: Thanks for your help 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Cool cool. Have a fantastic day! 
Student: You too 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello. 
Student: Hi 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What's your major? 
Student: Computer Science. 
Student: What courses do I still need to graduate? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You need to take EECS376 next semester. 
Student: Ok. What else? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which one do you like more, system, web or software development? 
Student: System. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Let me think for a moment 
Student: Sure. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 481 
Student: Why, is that about system? 
Advisor: [push-other]  Opps, I mean EECS482 
Student: Ok, that makes sense. 
Student: But is the workload very heavy? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Yes, it's extremely heavy. 
Student: Do I meet the prerequisite for EECS482? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, you just need to take EECS281. 
Student: I want to take EECS381 too. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you take 381, I strongly suggest you to drop something else 
Student: The workload is too much? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, you can just take one of 482 and 381. 
Student: Okay, I will think about that. 
Student: thank you for your advice. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye! 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Mara! 
Student: I am thinking about taking 482 and 376 together. Is that going to be too hard to do? 
Student: Will it be too easy? 
Student: Should I take one more eecs class with those two? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you've already taken 376 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Is there a different EECS class you were thinking of? 
Student: Oh, I meant that I wanted to take 485. I hear the projects are pretty big in that class. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 485 is an easier course compared to some of the other EECS courses. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any web experience? 
Student: Yes, I did an internship last summer where I worked on a website and I have also created my own website. 
Student: I think I would feel pretty comfortable in the class with HTML and CSS. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think the EECS 485 projects won't be as much work if you already have some web experience so it will probably be a good course for you to take if you are taking other EECS classes as well. 
Student: Thank you so much for all your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! Good luck in your classes! 

Student: Good morning, professor 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good morning, what can I do for you? 
Student: I need some advice about what courses to choose next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok, are there any particular courses you want to take? 
Student: I want to take EECS 584, but I'm not sure if it's a good desicion 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your background, you may find this course difficult. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The EECS584 has a prerequisite course EECS484. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You can take EECS484 first. 
Student: Are there sections in the afternoon? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  No, EECS484 is in the morning. 
Student: OK, that's fine, I will take 484 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  OK, good luck! 

Advisor: [pull-select]  How can I help you? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yo 
Student: hi 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  You gonna take 482 and 381 next semester? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Oh you're pretty smart, that should be no problem. 
Student: Yes I am worried about the workload of both 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would like to suggest another class, what else would you like to take? 
Student: I would like to take EECS376 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Have you taken the prereq: 1? 
Student: yes i have 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Oh nice, what was that again? 
Student: I think it was EECS203 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Oh that's very helpful for eecs 376. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What upper levels are you expecting to take next semester? 
Student: Only 493 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Oh that's unfortunate, it is only offered in the fall. Can I suggest EECS494? 
Student: Good idea 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Ian! 
Student: Hi Professor Qijun, I have some questions for the course selection for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Sure. What is your concerns about the course selection? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you want to take EECS 280? 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  hi 
Student: hello! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you hate your major? 
Student: not historically 
Advisor: [pull-select]  If you had to pick a mjaor that was totally unemployable and made Aron sad, what would it be? 
Student: sociology 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  If you had to guess my career satisfaction, where would you put it from zero to ten? 
Student: i mean christ zero right? has to be 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Celtics and grill? 
Student: yes'm 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on what you are telling me I would encourage you to start a regiment of twelve fake conversations per day. 
Student: How can I make Trump not president? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would encourage you to use your krav maga knowledge and ~*~intervene~*~ 
Student: I hear what you're saying 
Student: I love you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  c u later, alligator 
Student: peace out brussel sprout 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Hi, is there something I can help you with? 
Student: Yes, a big mac and large fries please 
Student: Just kidding, I'm not sure if I should double major in Computer Science and Business 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Hmm, I'm quite hungry too. Well Computer Science is already a very demanding degree. This usually takes students more than 4 years 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you comfortable spending more than 4 years in school? 
Student: No, I will do it in 3.5 
Student: What is the max number of credits I can take per semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Based on your current progress, that is not possible. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  18 credits, which is strictly enforced. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What do you hope to gain with a Business degree? 
Student: I want to be able to detect bull shit better 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Hmm, you have a point. Have you heard of EECS 498 on Natural Language Processing though? 
Student: I've heard that class is great! 
Student: Do you think a business degree isn't worth my time? 
Student: I've heard TO 313 is amazing 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's a great class if you're interested in analyzing language as you've hinted at 
Student: That's a good point. I think i'll take business classes on the side to train a NLP classifier to detect business related BS 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That's a great idea. 
Student: Now if only I could turn all of the lecture recordings into text transcripts... 
Student: Thanks! You've been so helpful 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Great, keep up the great work! I wish you all the best, in my humble opinion. 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Hello 
Student: Can you give me some suggestions about what courses to take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, you can take EECS281 
Student: Why? What is EECS281 about. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  EECS is about Introduction to algorithm analysis and O-notation; Fundamental data structures including lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, binary trees, search trees, balanced trees and graphs; searching and sorting algorithms; recursive algorithms; basic graph algorithms; introduction to greedy algorithms and divide and conquer strategy. Several programming assignments. 
Student: Cool. Any other suggested courses? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest EECS 370 
Student: Which professors will be teaching EECS 370 next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Reetuparna Das 
Student: Is that a programming course? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, it's a programming course. 
Student: Is it going to be too much workload to take EECS281 and EECS370 together? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  No. It's on average workload. 
Student: Thank you for your advice, that's very helpful. 
Student: Bye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye 

Advisor: [social-continue]  Hi there! Are you having a good day? 
Student: Hi! I am having a good day. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in the Computer Science major? 
Student: No, I am not interested in the Computer Science major. 
Student: I think I want to do the Computer Science minor instead. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Great! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It looks like you've taken EECS280. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would suggest taking EECS281 next. 
Student: Okay. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How do you feel about that? 
Student: I liked EECS 280 so I think I will like EECS 281. 
Student: What other classes do I need to take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Students interested in the major should take EECS370 and EECS376. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in either? 
Student: No I am not. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Okay. Perhaps you should take other classes that interest you, in addition to EECS281. 
Student: Okay 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a nice day! 
Student: Thanks! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how are you today? 
Student: Fantastic 
Student: Could you give me some suggestions about course selection? 
Advisor: [social-other]  Sure. Let me take a look at your background. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which topics are you interested in, software courses or hardware courses> 
Student: Both are fine for me 
Student: Maybe hardware, if any 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your background, I would suggest you taking EECS 470. 
Student: When does this class start and end? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  This course starts at 15:00, and ends at 16:30. 
Student: Nice, I won't take class in evening 
Student: What's the class size/ 
Student: ? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The class size is 58. 
Student: Happy to know this 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any other questions? 
Student: No, I think I will take this class! 
Student: Thank you. 
Student: Bye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You are welcome! Bye! 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What would you like help with today? 
Student: Selecting courses 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What topics are you interested in? 
Student: computers 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You are required to take EECS376 to graduate. 
Student: Can I graduate on time? 

Student: Hello 
Student: How are you? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  I'm a computer. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  I have no emotions 
Student: Well I'm sorry to hear that. However, I am looking for courses to take next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  As you have almost completed your CS degree, you can choose from a variety of upper level and graduate courses 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What is your dream job? 
Student: I want to be a chef. 
Student: But I would settle for a UI developer. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Well if you want to be a world class chef, I would suggest you take EECS 567: Robotic Kinematics and Dynamics and build su-chef robots 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Nobody has time for chopping! 
Student: If we allow the robots to walk, can't they hurt us? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Why do you think that? 
Student: This might surprise you but I watch Westworld. 
Student: I know they hate us. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  They?! 
Student: Goodbye. 

Student: Hi Kevin! I just finished my EECS 280 last semester and I wanted advice on which courses I should take next. 
Student: Can you help me? 
Student: hi kevin 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Hi Shan! May I know what your intended major is? 
Student: I am planning to major in CSE 
Advisor: [pull-select]  How did you do in 280? 
Student: I got and A 
Student: an* 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That's great! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I can see that you are a very exceptional student, I feel comfortable allowing you to take a heavier workload based on your performance in 280 
Student: which class should i be taking? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take 376, 281, 475, and 370 
Student: Ok, i will register for them right now! 
Student: thanks, and have a good day 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Cool! Just follow up with me if you have any further questions 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Hello 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you want to take literature class? 
Student: Yeah, that sounds interesting. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What kind of class are you interested in? 
Student: CLCIV375 was fun, so a class with a similar topic would be neat. 
Student: I am also interested in taking more EECS classes too. 
Student: What kind of classes would you suggest? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I suggest the class EECS 281. 
Student: Yeah, that way I can start taking the electives. Which elective courses would you suggest for later semesters? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest class EECS 475. This course is interesting and very useful. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How many courses will you plan to take? 
Student: Only around 12-14 credits worth. I would prefer to keep my workload light this semester. 
Advisor: [push-other]  Ok. 
Student: Probably I'll take 281 this semester and a Greek literature class plus another elective. 

Student: Hi, I don't know what to take next semester 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello! 
Student: I'm torn between German and Computer Science 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  May I suggest taking EECS 280? 
Student: Ok, sounds good. 
Student: What else? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  DO you have any other questions? 
Student: EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It seems like you have already taken EECS 203 
Student: Oh, I meant to say, what if I didn't like EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest dropping out of the CS major. 
Student: Do I need to take another math class? 
Student: I already did Calc 3 
Student: I think I enjoy programming, just not the theoretical stuff 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest taking Linear Algebra. 
Student: Ok cool. Thanks 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No problem! 

Student: HI!!!!!! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  AYOOOOOO 
Student: HOW ARE YOU TODAY? 
Advisor: [social-other]  WASSUP WASSUP 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I ask the questions around here 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is there something I can help you with? 
Student: MY CAPS LOCK KEY SEEMS TO BE BROKEN 
Student: I'M PLANNING MY COURSES FOR NEXT SEMESTER AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT JAPANESE CLASS I SHOULD TAKE 
Student: ?????????????? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would strongly suggest taking ASIANLAN 125 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It will give you a strong foundation in the Japanese language, which is essential to understand the culture 
Student: Good news. My caps lock key seems to be fixed. Macs are great. Apple is awesome. Everything mac is awesome. AWESOME!!! 
Student: Oh, that's helpful 
Student: Do you recommend studying abroad? 
Student: 日本は涼しい場所だと思うから。 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I'm sorry but I don't speak Japanese 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think studying abroad is a useful experience, but it comes down to opportunity cost. I would suggest asking your friends, mentors, and parents about it 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Looking at your schedule, however, it seems that you would be able to fit it in next semester 
Student: Great, thanks so much! AWESOME!!! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: No, that is all. In my humble opinion. Thank you so much. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Your welcome. Have a great year! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, how are you? 
Student: Hi, how's it going? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  I am well.  What can I help you with today? 
Student: I hear I will need to take EECS 281. Am I set to do that next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  To take EECS 281 you will need both EECS 280 and EECS 203. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Looking at your courses, you have not taken EECS 203. 
Student: Really? What is 203 about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 is a 4 credit course on Discrete Mathematics. 
Student: I need another math class for 281? What type of math is discrete math? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Discrete Math is a course on logic, graphs, and algorithms.  It isn't classified as a math course due to how integrated it is with other EECS courses. 
Student: Oh. It sounds interesting. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Since EECS 281 and EECS 203 are pre-reqs for many other EECS courses, I highly suggest you take them as soon as possible. 
Student: Definitely. Thanks for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good luck in your studies, bye. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how are you doing today? 
Student: Hi I'm doing well thank you! I am wondering about what types of classes to take that will be helpful for my major 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you enjoy your previous programming classes? 
Student: No not really :/ 
Student: I was thinking about EECS so I tried it out, but it was too hard 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you did not enjoy those classes, then I would suggest maybe getting a major in german. 
Student: Yeah i am interested in language, but also math. Is there a math class you suggest? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest taking stats 450. 
Student: What's the next easiest EECS class I can take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest eecs 475 as it has the highest easiness rating possible. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Another eecs class with a light workload is eecs 370. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Have you decided on what major you are going to get? 
Student: No 
Student: Not yet 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  A degree in computer science is pretty popular due to the growing industry. 
Student: Okay ill think aboutit 
Student: thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Your welcome. Come back anytime if you have any questions. 

Student: Hello! 
Student: I don't know much about the upper-level EECS classes, what would you recommend I take next semester in order to graduate on time with my CS major? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have a general idea of what you are interested in, in the field of Computer Science? 
Student: I really enjoy security! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you are interested in Security I recommend that you take EECS 388. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should first complete the prerequisites for that course, 281 and 370. 
Student: Oh right, thank you! 
Student: Are there any other classes that are highly recommended that I take as an upper level elective? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you are taking EECS 388, a good supplement would be Web Databases, EECS 485. 
Student: Great, thank you!! 
Student: Have a good day! 

Student: Hi Professor Ian! 
Student: I hope you could give me some advice on the course selection for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Hi qijun, are you a sophomore student? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  what area do u want to explore 
Student: I am interested in software development, and I want to learn something about AI or game design 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well, then i highly recommend you to take EECS494 Game Design course. It's a fantastic course with great faculties. 
Student: Sounds good. May I know the workload of this course? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  The workload is 2.5. If you are ok with the workload for EECS281. I think you are ok with this. 
Student: Hmmm I think 281 is ok, so hopefully I can handle 494, too 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have other questions? 
Student: Yes. Could you please tell me the class size? I prefer not to take a course with too many students 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The course size is around 60 and considered to be normal for senior design course 
Student: Sounds great! I will take it! 
Student: Thank you! Good bye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye! 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Hi, how can I help you? 
Student: I don't care for calculus. What computer science courses would be good for me? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, absolutely. This would be a perfect time to start taking CS courses. 
Student: What course should I take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Since you've already taken EECS280, the logical progression would be to take EECS281 (data structures and algorithms), EECS370 (Intro to computer organization), and/or EESC376 (Foundations of computer science). 
Student: Which two would be best together? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would suggest taking EESC376 as your easier course in conjunction with either of the other two as your more difficult course. 
Student: Ok, I will take that and EECS281 next semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Great. 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hey there 
Student: I don't know what to take next semester 
Student: help 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What can I do for you? 
Student: I am thinking of taking EECS 482 next semester 
Student: Should I? 
Student: What other classes should I take with it? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take easy classes with EECS 482 as this is a difficult class 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Try taking stats250 with EECS 482, because it is an easier class 
Student: I already took stats 250 
Student: I was thinking of taking physics 240 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you generally good at physic? 
Student: I failed 140 3 times 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I don't think you should be taking physics with EECS 482 then. The workloads are too high in combination 
Student: Ok. Thank you. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem. Good luck next semester 

Advisor: [pull-select]  What classes would you like to take next semester? 
Student: I would like to take EECS280 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That's a great choice of a class. I was actually going to suggest that you take that class. 
Student: What other classes would you suggest that I take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Well, based on your course history, I would also suggest taking EECS 203 and EECS 183. 
Student: Out of the 3 classes you suggested, what do you think will be the easiest? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Because EECS 183 has the highest EasinessRating on your course history, I would say that EECS 183 is going to be the easiest. 
Student: Oh okay, thank you! I will sign up for EECS 183. 

Student: Hi 
Advisor: [social]  Hello Zach 
Student: I wanted to ask your opinion about what classes I should take next semester. 
Advisor: [pull]  What kind of classes have you taken so far? 
Student: I've only taken general engineering requirements and gen-ed so far. 
Advisor: [pull]  Would you like to continue with the Engineering program? 
Student: Yes, I think I would like to major in CS. 
Advisor: [push]  The first CS courses most Engineering students take are EECS 183, EECS 280, EECS 203 
Advisor: [push]  If a student is advanced, they may test out of EECS 183 
Student: How would you go about doing that? 
Advisor: [push]  If you would like to do so, you can do a sample project that is of difficulty equal to a EECS 280 project. It will then be graded 
Advisor: [pull]  Would you like to do so? Do you have experience with programming? 
Student: Yes, I think I could give it a shot. 
Advisor: [push]  In that case, I would suggest do that over the summer and signing up for EECS 280 and EECS 203. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  IS there anything else i can help you with today? 
Student: No. I think that's it. Thank you. 
Advisor: [social]  Great! Have a nice day 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! How can I help you today? 
Student: I need help figuring out my schedule for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Ok, are you satisfied with the CS major? 
Student: Yes, I love programming! 
Student: But I also really love Math 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Well, as far as EECS classes go, EECS 445, Introduction to Machine Learning is very math-heavy. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You may also consider a math minor. 
Student: Ok 
Student: How much work is EECS 445? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  It can be a lot of work if your background in linear algebra or statistics is limited because the class involves a lot of math. 
Student: Well I have taken a lot of calculus and enjoyed those classes 
Student: Will I be able to take EECS 445 next semester? 
Student: Or are the prereqs I still need to take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The only enforced prerequisite is EECS 281. Advisory prerequisites include a linear algebra class and a statistics class. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you think you can handle it, go for it. 
Student: Ok. What other ULCS classes would be good to take with 445? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Since you haven't taken EECS 370, and it's required for graduation and many other ULCS classes, I suggest that you take EECS 370. 
Student: Oh Ok. That sounds great. Thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Is that all? 
Student: Yes. 
Student: Have a great day! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a good day. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Jack! 
Student: Hi Ms. Kollin how are you today? 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Good! What can I help you with today? 
Student: So, I've taken EECS 370, and I really enjoyed it. I am thinking of taking EECS482 next, but I've hear it is a very difficult course. What do you know about the class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Compared to other classes that you have taken, such as EECS 281 and EECS 370, EECS 482 is said to be slightly harder among students that have taken it. That being said,it has been noted to be one of the most beneficial upper level courses. 
Student: Gotcha.  I am also very interested in web dev. Do you have any classes that you think I should to learn more about it? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would recommend taking EECS 485, Web Databases and Information Systems. EECS 484, Database Management Systems, expands upon some of the database topics discussed in EECS 485. EECS 493, User Interface Development, is also extremely beneficial for developers designing websites and web applications. 
Student: I've heard 493 is LITTTT. thanks for the advice.  So on a different note.  I tryna buy a fresh whip to show of to all my homies. Are there any coding opportunities outside of the classroom that I could pursue in order to accumulate some cheddah $$$$$ 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  There are a ton of paid research opportunities that I would look into pursuing! If you liked 370, you might really enjoy research involving artificial intelligence and machine learning. Jenna Weins would be a great person to contact. 
Student: Sweet! Lastly, sometimes EECS can get super overwhelming and I've often thought that I wanna pursue other majors.  Do you think I should continue with EECS 
Student: ? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Computer Science is extremely difficult, but it will be worth it! You brought up money previously, well research has shown that Computer Science majors make a starting salary of over $100,000 per year. If you are becoming too overwhelmed, there are plenty of people that you can contact to discuss time management skills and learning how to deal with stress. 
Student: word, thanks, BYEEE 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello how are you! How can I help you today? 
Student: Hello, Mr. Advisor! I have some questions about future courses that are bit more academically challenging. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Sure! Ask away!~ 
Student: I know I want to pursue an Engineering degree. MATSCIE 220 and AEROSP 201 were both interesting, but were light in terms of coursework. What other options in the engineering school are available? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  There are many options to do in engineering.  It seems like you enjoy physical engineering courses, so I would suggest also looking into Mechanical engineering.  I would also suggest doing research with certain design teams in order to get the experience perhaps before you take the classes themselves it is a great way to boost your resume and explore your options 
Student: That's interesting. Most of my classes thus far have been rather large, but I'm not sure if design team research is a viable option for me. How many hours of work do they generally take per week? 
Student: Most of my courses have also been in the morning. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  There are multiple teams on campus that you can look into who make really cool engineering projects.  The time commitment is mostly based on the team you choose.  They usually let you put in as little more much time as you want.  This could be a good way to expand your horizons too and not have as large of a time commitment 
Student: Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-other]  Sure! Have a good day and good luck! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! How can I help you today? 
Student: Hi! I'm here to discuss what courses to take for next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What types of courses were you looking at? 
Student: I was looking at filling out my cs requirements. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS376, EECS370, and EECS281 are all great courses that satisfy cs major requirements 
Student: I usually would prefer not having a big workload.  Would it be a lot of work to take them all in the same semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I've heard that all three together can be a moderately high workload, but it can be done. 
Student: Thanks!  I think I'll take one of 376 and 370 with 281.  Which of the two would you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 370 and EECS 281 are requirements for a lot of upper level classes that people find interesting, so if you want to start taking more higher level classes, I would suggest those two. Otherwise, EECS 376 and EECS 281 might be a lighter workload. 
Student: Alright, taking 370 sounds pretty important then for upper level classes.  Do people generally find this class difficult? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  People generally find 370 to be of a light to moderate workload 
Student: Alright, sounds good.  I think I know what I'll do for next semester! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok, bye! 

Student: Hola! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  こんにちは！はじめまして。 
Student: Do you have someone who speaks english? 
Student: I cannot understand your accent 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I'm sorry, I'll speak in English for the remaining of this session. 
Student: Thank you. I really want to take physics 240 and eecs 280 
Student: but not 203 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I teach 280, you should definitely take it. It's a challenging class but it's the best. I have the best classes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Why do you not want to take 203? 
Student: I don't know if I like math 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I have the best IAs. 
Student: what about AI's? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What makes you think you might not like math? 
Student: I hated math 255 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What part of MATH 255 did you dislike? 
Student: I disliked the teacher 
Student: and it was early in the morning 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Try not to determine your future based on one bad experience. 
Student: wow thank you 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you don't do mornings, you should take afternoon classes. 
Student: hmmm that is an interesting suggestion 
Student: I think i will do that 
Student: hello? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: no... I guess I will leave. Thank you for your help 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a nice day. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hello 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What type of advising would you like today? 
Student: I need to pick out a course for next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok, what kind of courses are you interested in? 
Student: I am open to anything. What would you recommend given I like clear professors? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  There's lots of classes that have clear professors. EECS 494, EECS 381, and EECS 481 all have clear professors. You might want to avoid EECS 478 and EECS 441 though. 
Student: Of EECS 494, 381, and 481, which has the largest classes? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  All three classes are around the same size, around 40-60. EECS 481 is the biggest though. 
Student: Which class is the hardest? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Out of those classes, EECS 381 is the hardest. 
Student: Which course has the lightest workload? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 481 is the easiest out of those classes. 
Student: Ok Thank you. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem! 

Student: Hey! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi friend! 
Student: I'm not your friend 
Advisor: [social-continue]  What do you need? 
Student: can you help me pick a class to take? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Sure!!!! 
Student: thanks! 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Seeing as u've taken ENGR 101, you should take a 200 level EECS class like EECs 203 or 280 
Student: okay. Which one is harder? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 is rated to be easier than 280 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  But both classes are important to be a CS major 
Student: okay, I will take both! 
Student: thank you 
Student: bye! 
Student: xoxo 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  pce 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you doing well today? 
Student: I'm doing great, thank you. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What do you need help with? 
Student: I would like to schedule classes for the upcoming semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What classes are you interested in? 
Student: I am interested in classes regarding Computer Hardware. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Let me think for a moment. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Let me think for another moment. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Let me think for a third moment. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You are required to take EECS 281 before graduating. 
Student: Is that still true for Computer Engineering majors? 
Advisor: [social-other]  Hmm. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your graduation requirements, I think you will still need to take 281. 
Student: Okay, sounds good. 
Student: What other courses would you suggest for my schedule? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you're taking 281, then I suggest taking EECS 376. 
Student: Is EECS 376 a hard class? 
Advisor: [push-other]  This depends on your personal preference. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You are required to take 376 to graduate. 
Student: All right then.  Do you have any suggestions for easy courses? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest EECS 475 for its lighter workload than most upper level EECS courses. 
Student: Okay that sounds great.  Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds good. Bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any preferences? 
Student: Yes 
Student: I prefer to attend class in morning about computer hardware and the workload shouldn't be too heavy. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you interested in computer organization? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which level of easiness rating do you prefer, easy, medium or hard? 
Student: Medium, I guess 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your background and preferences, EECS 370 Introduction to Computer Organization is too difficult for you. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I strongly suggest you taking EECS 281. 
Student: OK, that looks interesting to me 
Student: I have taken 280 last semester so I think it wouldn't be too hard for me! 
Student: WQhat's the class size by the way? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The class size for EECS281 is 81. 
Student: Nice 
Student: I will take it 
Student: Thank you very much! 
Student: Bye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You are welcome! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  See you ! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi how are you today? What can I help you with? 
Student: I'm a sophomore, what classes would you suggest I take to learn more about computer science 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  As a sophomore, you should take 281, 376, and 475. 
Student: I feel like three EECS courses would be too hard of a semester for me 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If the classes sound too hard, then I suggest you take just EECS 281 and EECS 475. One has a good clarity rating while 281 is necessary for other classes. 
Student: Ok, how large is 475, I prefer classes that are small or medium sized 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 475 is small to medium based. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Can you provide me more information on what you want? 
Student: What is the difficulty rating of 475 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 475 has a easiness rating of 5. 
Student: Ok, I'll take that class then. Thank you for your advice. Have a good day 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You too! I'm glad I could be of help. Have a nice day! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, how can I help you? 
Student: what upper level classes should I take? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken EECS 280? 
Student: Yes, that and 281 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ok, you have a range of classes to take. I recommend EECS 492 or EECS 494 
Student: Can I take those together? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes you can. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You also need to take EECS 370 to graduate. 
Student: What is that about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 370 is Computer Organization. You learn assembly 
Student: how difficlt is that class? 
Student: can I do an upper level with it? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You seem like a good student so it probably will be regular difficulty 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes I think you can 
Student: Great; thanks for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome. Bye 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hey there, how can I help you today? 
Student: I'd like to select courses in Web Development next semester. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I recommend you consider EECS 485 and EECS 484. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you like me to elaborate further on either of those classes? 
Student: Indeed I would! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 485 is Web Databases and covers a lot of web technologies.  EECS 484 is Database Management Systems and explores concepts and methods regarding large enterprise databases. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I think any student interested in web development should consider these courses. 
Student: Ok, I'll definitely look into that. 
Student: Will taking both of these classes weigh heavily on my course load? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you choose to take one or both of these classes, you should look into easier classes to round out your semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both of these classes are 4 credit upper levels. 
Student: Uh-oh. I'm not sure if I can add more credits to my packed schedule. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Perhaps for now, you should select one over the other. 
Student: I don't know which one to pick. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you more interested in general web technology, or in backend database management? 
Student: I think I'd prefer Web Technology. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 485 covers more topics in web development. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Based on what you've told me as well as your prior classes, I think you EECS 485 would be a good course for you to take. 
Student: I'll be sure to take that next semester! Thank you and good-bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! Welcome to advising, how can I help you today? 
Student: I really want to take eecs 281 next semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can't take 281 without taking 280 first. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you're interested in 281, you should take 280 and 203 next semester. 
Student: But 281 sounds more interesting for me next semester 
Student: Are there any fun classes i can take 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can take Aliens, it's about aliens. It's really interesting and really gets you out of this world. 
Student: Maybe I should take 183 first before doing 280 
Student: I'm scared 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your schedule, I think you're ready to try 280. It may be a challenge, but it will help you grow 
Student: How hard is it 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's a challenging course, but if you put in the time you will be successful. 
Student: But how are you doing today? 
Student: This has been really helpful 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I'm glad you found this helpful. I'm good. Anything else I can help you with today?: 
Student: can I have your number incase i have more questions? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can come to my office hours listed on the website if you have any further questions. 
Student: okay.... goodbye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a nice day :-) 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Whaddup baby! 
Student: Hello good sir! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  WHAT BRINGS YOU IN TODAY? 
Student: I LOVE taking hard eecs classes! 
Student: also shahar says hello! 
Student: and hannah wants to know what's up 
Student: but back to business 
Student: i want MORE HARD classes! 
Advisor: [social-other]  Not much is up at all 
Advisor: [social-other]  hello shahar 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest taking EECS 493 and EECS 388 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Those classes are considered very challenging 
Student: Gotchua 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What else would you like to discuss? 
Student: but what else should i take? 
Student: like for funsies? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Tupac once said bitches love taking EECS 485 
Student: hey! 
Student: i have a friend in that now 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think you would enjoy taking EECS 492 
Student: and shes no b -word 
Student: I will think about it. Do you have any non-EECS class I might like? 
Student: also can I graduate early/ 
Student: I'd like to get out of this place ASAP 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Nope! I suggest nothing non-EECS. 
Student: oh 
Student: okay 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You never get to graduate, much less graduate early. 
Student: well 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye! 
Student: thats a bummer 
Student: bye!!!! 
Student: i will miss you 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! What brings you to advising today? 
Student: Hello sir. I was just getting to planning my next semester and was hoping you could make some elective suggestions. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are there any particular areas of computer science that you're interested in? 
Student: Not in particular. I'm still trying to narrow down exactly what interests me most. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Hmmm... well then, I'd say that many people Databases (484) to be a good general course which has applications in many areas of CS. 
Student: That sounds interesting but I only have times available in the mornings. Does that class have any morning sections? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  To be honest, our system is being a bit finnicky right now, but I can say that it's a relatively popular class so there should be multiple sections available. 
Student: That's good to know! Thank you so much! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Okay. Glad I could help! Is there anything else. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Housekey! How may I help you today? 
Student: Good morning. Not sure what classes to take 
Student: I'm interested in pursuing a Computer Science degree 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest you take either EECS 280 or EECS 183. 
Student: What is the difference? 
Student: Can I take EECS 280? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 183 is a more preliminary programming course that teaches the basics of programming concepts. 
Student: I think I'm comfortable with programming - I did pretty well in ENGR 101. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 280 is a more advanced course that teaches elementary data structures and programming structure. 
Student: What else should I take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest you take EECS 280 then. 
Student: Should I take a tech elective or somethign? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes. EECS 280 is a moderately difficult course, but can be paired with technical electives as wel. 
Student: Ok, I think I wanna take a civil engineering course. 
Student: Can I take any of them? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  An introductory civil engineering course may be suitable for you. 
Student: Thanks. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome. Have a nice day. 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, I'm Jackie your advisor. 
Student: Is it a good idea to take EECS 482 and 381 at the same time? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's definitely a bad idea to take those two classes together. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Why are you considering taking these two together? 
Student: I don't want to have a social life 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It's a better idea to lessen your work load though, you won't have a social life regardless. I'd suggest taking EECS 381 before 482 with some lighter courses. 
Student: How about EECS 381 and Dance 100? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  That sounds good 
Student: What classes do you suggest I take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  What are you interested in? 
Student: Machine learning! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 445 would be a good fit for you then. 
Student: Okay thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome. I hope you have a good day. Make sure to write a review for me. 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: i need to take one more class next semester 
Student: what do i take 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 482 
Student: i heard that was a difficult class 
Student: i am worried about my gpa 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What is your gpa? 
Student: 3.6 
Student: i want to go to grad school 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You need a good gpa to go to grad school 
Student: what gpa do i need to get into grad school 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  but also some good courses 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  4.5 
Student: what courses will prepare me for computer science grad school? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 482, EECS 373, EECS 492 
Student: what is eecs 492? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how are you? 
Student: Good! I just have some questions about my courses for next semester. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Okay, please continue 
Student: Is it recommended that I take 376, 281, and 370 at the same time? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's doable, but it's a heavy workload 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I wouldn't advise it for most other students 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are you planning on taking any other classes besides those? 
Student: I am taking a 4-credit psychology class to fulfill my breadth requirement 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would personally suggest against taking 281,370 and 376 with your psychology class 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Taking 281 + 370 is generally the more standard route 
Student: Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Thank you! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Any other questions? 
Student: Not at the moment. Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Farewell 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How can I help you today? 
Student: I enjoyed primarily theoretical courses in my undergrad. What are some options for me now? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It depends, would you like to take a class that is more structured or driven by yourself? 
Student: Structured 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then I would suggest eecs595 or eecs591. 
Student: Which has smaller class size? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS591. 
Student: Which is easier? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Also EECS591. 
Student: Seems like my obvious choice is EECS591 
Student: thanks! 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Brady! How can I help you toda?Y 
Student: I'm trying to figure out what classes to take next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Can you tell me what classes you've enjoyed in the past? 
Student: I really enjoyed EECS 280. How can I continue with the CS program? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you enjoyed EECS 280, you should take EECS 203 next. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Taking EECS 203 will allow you to take EECS 281, and then the rest of the upper-level EECS classes. 
Student: What is EECS 203 about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 a class about discrete math. It covers basic set theory, algorithm design, complexity, and probability, among other topics. 
Student: That sounds hard. Is it a tough class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Overall, it has been rated as fairly easy by most EECS students. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Although it can be very difficult if you don't study for the exams. 
Student: I am interested in morning classes. What time is EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 203 is a morning class. You would definitely enjoy it. 
Student: Great! I'll take it next semester. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Glad I coul help! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Hi there 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in theoretical computer science? 
Student: No 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What sort of classes are you interested in? 
Student: I am looking to have a computer science major so I would like to take some EECS classes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Theoretical information is generally considered helpful for computer science majors. 
Student: I am not looking to do tehoretical computer science as I said before 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in web development then? 
Student: Yes! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Great! Then EECS 485 might be just the thing that you're looking for. 
Student: Great! Am I even allowed to take that class advisor? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No. You have to take 281 before taking it as that is a prerequisite. But keep that in mind for the future as it may not be offered both semesters. 
Student: Aw man, you got me all hyped up for no reason 
Student: What is 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  281 is a weeder course that you normally take in your sophomore year. It teaches you data structures and algorithms. 
Student: Great to know. I will definitely take it. Thank you. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Great! Nice speaking with you. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, how can I help today? 
Student: Hi, can I declare CS as my major? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes you can 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you are going to declare CS, I advise you to take 281 as soon as possible 
Student: What is the difference between LSA and ENgineering CS? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The difference is mainly the prerequisites. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Once you take upper levels they are mainly the same 
Student: Would you recommend one over the other? 
Student: and why? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think you should be Engineering CS 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You have taken most of the prerequisites for CS-ENGIN 
Student: Okay, then can I officially declare myself as a CS Engineering major right now? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes you can 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I just need you to sign this form 
Student: Great! Thank you so much for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome. BYe 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Brady! 
Student: Hello Dr. S! How's it hanging? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I am doing well. How can I help you today? 
Student: I have no idea what I should take semester! Do you have a copy of my transcript available? 
Advisor: [social-other]  I do have a copy of your transcript. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I see you took EECS 270 and EECS 370. Did you enjoy those classes? 
Student: I liked EECS 370 a lot more than EECS 270, mostly because it involved hardware. 
Student: It had the perfect class size: around 100 students! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interest in hardware, you should consider taking EECS 373: Design of Microprocessor-based Systems. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you are looking for a class size of around 100 students, EECS 281 has an average class size of about 80 students. 
Student: Although I like hardware, I also like working with software, and don't want to forget about it. For this reason, I am interested in EECS 281. 
Student: What time of the day is EECS 281? I really like morning classes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 is at 8:00 AM in the morning. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interest in morning classes, I suggest you take EECS 281 then! 
Student: Ok, thanks! What should I take as a non-EECS class? I don't want to overload myself! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You need to take EECS 376 at some point. Since it is not a programming class, it might be a nice break from your other EECS classes! 
Student: Interesting! What is the class about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 376 is about the theory of computation: turing machines, computability, complexity, and cryptography are among the subjects covered. 
Student: I'm still a little unclear on what this means. What is a turing machine? And will this class teach me if something is NP-complete? What does NP-complete mean, anyways? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You'll learn all about turing machines in this class! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  This class will teach you about NP-completeness. To learn more, I encourage you to take it. 
Student: Sounds like a plan, stan! Thanks Dr. S! I love you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Glad to hear that I could help! 

Student: hello! 
Advisor: [push]  hello kevin! how can I help you today 
Student: Hi so I was debating when I should take EECS 281 
Student: 381, sorry 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 381 is a OOP course that has a very heavy courseload but will improve your coding skills a lot! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is that a course you would be interested in? 
Student: No 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Why is that? Is your course load looking pretty heavy next semester? 
Student: I'm looking to take 376 and 482. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  it would not be a wise choice to combine 381 with another EECS course, unless you like to burn that midnight oil 
Student: Ok, I think I might just take 381 by itself 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That is a very wise choice, but don't forget to fulfill your other degree requirements. 
Student: Alright I will, thank you! 
Student: Goodbye! 

Student: Hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello there! What do you need today? 
Student: I want to know what classes you recommend I take. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you continue with EECS 281 and EECS 370 and or 376 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What other areas of study are you interested in? 
Student: I am interested in computer hardware. Which of those 3 classes would be most relevant for me? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 370 would be the most relevant, you learn about hardware architecture and design. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in taking math classes? 
Student: No not really. I actually want to take another histart class since I thought that it was really interesting. 
Student: Are there any that you reccomend> 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest that you take EECS 478 along with a history class dealing with middle age art as you took HISTART101 
Student: I was also wondering if I was on track to complete my computer engineering degree. 
Student: Did i finish all the required classes? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Given that you continue on your current track of EECS classes you are actually ahead as a freshman! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is there anything else you need? 
Student: That was all. Thank you for your help. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem! Have a nice day :) 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! Why are you in my office? 
Student: I'm here to ask about courses for next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What are your interests? 
Student: I'm primarily interested in Web Technology & Applications + Intelligent Systems 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Great, it looks like you still haven't taken EECS 281 though, so you should probably take it next semester. It's required for many upper level courses in your area of interest. 
Student: What can you tell me about the difficult of 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 is usually considered to be of moderate difficulty 
Student: What about the workload? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 is also of moderate workload 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How important is workload to you? 
Student: I can tolerate moderate workloads, so this works for me. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Then maybe you should also consider EECS 376, it's a requirement and it will set you up for some classes in Intelligent Systems. 
Student: What is 376 about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 376 covers: finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity. 
Student: That's quite a lot of topics, but a lot of them sound fascinating.  I think I'll take it along with 281, then. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Great! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any other questions? 
Student: None at the moment, since I'm locked into taking 281, basically. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok, see you around! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Sydney! 
Student: Hello Professor lefevre! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What courses do you want to take next semester? 
Student: I need to take another EECS elective 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What EECS topics interest you? 
Student: I am most interested in data analytics 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you want a heavier workload or a lighter workload next semester? 
Student: The heavier the better, because I need to be prepared for job interviews! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 545 is about Machine Learning and EECS 586 is about Design and Analysis of Algorithms. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Both would be a good fit for you, but taking both might be too difficult. 
Student: Are either or the classes in the afternoon or the evening? I do not like morning classes and would prefer to take whichever one is later in the day 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I suggest taking Machine Learning, because it is in the afternoon. 
Student: Great, I will take that class. Thank you so much for all of your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! Have a great day! 

Advisor: [pull-other]  Good evening, what brings you here today? 
Student: I've been having an internal debate with myself over whether or not I should head down the VLSI path or the Computer Vision path. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I highly reccommend computer vision over VLSI, since there is more opportunity there to make automated learning systems. 
Student: What courses are offered in the computer vision area here at the University of Michigan? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 442 is offered every semester, with the professors in CSE and ECE rotating which teaches it. 
Student: Who is the CSE professor and who is the ECE professor this next year? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think Jia Deng next, and next year Johnson-Roberson. 
Student: If I plan on having a busy term, should I still sign up for 442? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I'd suggest it, but it depends on how much work you'd want to put into the final project. If you want to do more with it, putting it off might be better. 
Student: I really want to do a cool final project. I was thinking about applying some computer vision techniques to music information retrieval. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  That sounds like a good final project. 
Student: I have and idea in mind and I'd tell you more about it but I don't want you to steal my idea. Anyway, I have to run to my tech comm 300 class before they take attendance. Bye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how may I help you? 
Student: Can I take EECS 482 next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No, you need to take EECS281 first. 
Student: Can I graduate without EECS281? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you declared your major? 
Student: I declare CS Major. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Cool. Then you need to take EECS 281 to graduate. 
Student: Thank you. 
Student: Do you have any other advices for me? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can take EECS 281 and EECS 370 together next semester. 
Student: Could you tell me something about EECS 370? Is it similar to EECS270? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 370 is about computer organization. Part of the materials are related to EECS 270. It is essential for you to graduate. 
Student: Thanks! 
Student: What about EECS 373? Can I take it next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No, It requires EECS 370 as prerequisite. 
Student: I'm so sad to hear that. 
Student: Is EECS281 difficult for me to take? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  No, given your background. It will not be too difficult. 
Student: Cool. Bye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Bye. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi there 
Student: hello, how's it going? 
Advisor: [social-other]  what would you like to know? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you enjoy EECS 370? 
Student: I liked eecs 370, i though professor dutta did a wonderful job 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you liked 370, I would suggest you look at EECS 470, which is an extension of that class 
Student: okay thanks, I will take a look into that class. 
Student: Would you recommend taking EECS 482? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 482 is a pretty tough class, but very helpful if you are willing to put in the time 
Student: Good to know, I will have to think about that one 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you interested most in Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, or Artificial Intelligence? 
Student: I think out of those three I am most interested in operating systems, and then maybe artificial intelligence 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Because of your interests, I would suggest taking EECS 482 and EECS 492, but not in the same semester 
Student: that's a good idea, I don't want to be too overwhelmed during one semester. thank you for your help! 

Student: Hey! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Student: So I'm enjoying EECS 280 but I'm not sure what I should take next semester. What do you think? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you are enjoying 280, I would recommend taking eecs203 and eecs281. Do you think you want to do computer science as a major? 
Student: I think so. I've heard 281 is really hard so I'm not sure if I want to take it. Should I still take it? I'm not sure what I want to do 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  281 is known to be the most difficult required class, but if you are enjoying 280, I think you will enjoy 281. There's also a lot of resources at Michigan to help you get through the class. You could join a study group, go to office hours or see a tutor. 
Student: Are there other EECS classes I could take with it? Or would that be too much work in one semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Many students taking 281 will also take 370, 203, or linear algebra. I would suggest one of these three to take with 281. 
Student: Okay I think I'll take 281 and 203. Thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Great! Have a great day. Thanks. 

Student: hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: I need help selecting an MDE 
Student: help me 
Advisor: [pull-select]  I see you are interested in MDE's. Please consider: POLSCI 111, EECS 280 or EECS 183 
Student: should i take 280? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 280 has coding. If you like coding, it would be a good fit for you 
Student: I like to code 
Student: ask me what else i like 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Go on 
Student: i like chemistry 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Here are a list of some chemistry classes: CHEM 130, CHEM 210, CHEM 211, CHEM 216 
Student: Will orgo hurt my GPA? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on my data, CHEM 210 looks fairly difficult 

Student: Hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How can I help you today? 
Student: I'm trying to find a fun course to take. What suggestions do you have? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What sort of courses are you interested in taking? 
Student: I would like to take a useful CS course. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You've already taken eecs280, so you have some options, including eecs370, 376, and 281 
Student: I heard 281 and 370 are useful. What would you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Those two are particularly challenging when taken together, and I see you've taken primarily non-technical courses so far, so I would suggest taking only one of those 
Student: Okay I guess I'll take 281. 

Student: What is up lil momma 
Student: II'm just kidding that was inappropriate 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Hello sir 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How can I help you today? 
Student: I am taking EECS 482 but it is ruining my life. I no longer have time to eat, sleep, see my family, or shower. What should I do? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You should give up all sorts of fun. Then you will have more time for the important things in life. Like finishing your projects 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  When your heart says go to ricks, dont 
Student: I have been using hard drugs to remain awake and i believe it is beginning to destroy my health 
Student: most of my teeth have begun to fall out 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Have you tried CAPS? 
Student: what class should i take as a substitue 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well. There is this other upper level cs class. It is called EECS 381. While you still won't eat, sleep, see your family, or shower. You should be able to get through it without hard drugs 
Student: Is it easy? I have 237 hours of sleep to catch up on and my cat misses me 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No 
Student: I will take eecs 183, what do you think? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Sounds really good! It should give you a refresher on all the essentials 
Student: Ok thank you, goodbye. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  It was great talking with you son 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Can I help you? 
Student: Should I take physics 240 next semster? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Why are you interested in physics 240? 
Student: I'm an engineering student 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  So physics 240 is a requirement for engineers 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  So yes you should take it before you graduate 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  When do you graduate? 
Student: Which semester would you recommend taking it? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  When do you grauduate? 
Student: April 2018 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  So it is not necessary to take it next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  So, you have to take it some time before you graduate. When is up to you and your schedule. It is a hard class, so pair it with some easier courses. 
Student: Thanks 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hey! What's up? 
Student: Which classes do you suggest I take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 481 and EECS 493. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Could you elaborate on the difficulty of the classes you enjoy taking? 
Student: What are the class sizes for those two classes? I'm looking for classes that have about 100 students 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 481 has a class size of 63.7 students on average and EECS 493 has a class size of 94.33 students on average. 
Student: Are those two classes available during the day? I highly prefer morning classes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The start time of the classes is not available to me. I suggest looking at the LSA course guide to find the class times. 
Student: How much are the workloads for those classes? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The workloads are not available to me, but the easiness ratings of the classes are 3.25 for EECS 481 and 2.93 for EECS 493. 
Student: Okay, thank you very much! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Howdy! How can I help you today? 
Student: I'm trying to schedule classes for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you looking to take more CS courses or couses outside engineering? 
Student: I have taken eecs 492 and have a big interest in math recently.  I am looking for 2 more upper level eecs classes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  There's a course offered in Theory of Neural Computation, EECS 643 
Student: Is that a real course? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It is! If you enjoyed 492, this might be a good course to take next. 
Student: Okay!  That sounds good since I enjoy taking calc classes during my summer breaks 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Unfortunately, I am only able to offer EECS course guidance 
Student: Okay, is there a second class you would recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  There are some more math-heavy courses, like Intro to Algorithms and Matrix Methods. 
Student: Cool!  Thanks.  If only the rest of my life was this simple 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hello 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you know what classes you want to take? 
Student: No. I'd like morning classes if possible 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Well, considering you have taken most of the prerequisite, I would suggest taking EECS 183 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What area of study are you most interested in? 
Student: Computer hardware is my priority with web technologies as my second choice 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Great! I would suggest taking EECS 370 as this is the introductory course for computer hardware and EECS 485 which is the web development course. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are there any other areas of computer science that you are interested in? 
Student: Theory of computation 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Okay, I know theory is very important for understanding computer science concepts, I would suggest taking EECS 376 as it is focused on the theory. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How many courses are you looking to take? 
Student: depends on the workload of each course, which is something I want to ask you about 
Student: What's the workload like for the courses you have suggested? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Of course, EECS 183 and EECS 280 are introductory level courses so the work load is not too bad, EECS 370 EECS 376, and EECS 485 are all upper level courses so the workload is much greater. 
Student: I've already taken Eecs 101 which I believe is equivalent to 183. It that right? 
Student: Or can I get credit for both? 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Student: Hello 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What can I help you with?

Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you are preparing for engineering. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you planning on EECS? 
Student: It seems appealing, but I'm not sure. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  How have you liked EECS classes?  Good, bad, or neither? 
Student: They've been good. 
Student: What should I take next? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 280 looks like a good next step for either CE or CS 
Student: Okay, I'll think on it 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask them here 
Student: Thanks for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem, bye!

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Why are you in advising? 
Student: I feel like my classes have been too easy even with the accelerated curriculum, and I would like some suggestions for what to do next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What kind of subjects are you interested in? 
Student: I really like learning about quantum computing and string theory, which I spoke to my Physics 140 professor about in office hours one day. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You may want to look into some honors physics courses. 
Student: Yeah, I sat in on physics 598 and found it quite dull as well... 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  There is also a physics club on campus that you should join. They may discuss topics that are more interesting to you. 
Student: Oh wow! I think that would really help me narrow my interests. 
Student: Thank you so much! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! Come back to advising any time! :)

Student: I don't know what classes I should take next semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  According to my information, you still need to take EECS203 
Student: Okay, what else can I take with EECS 203? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Perhaps you could take some of the econ minor requirements with it 
Student: Do you think that would be too much work? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you find EECS280 to be hard? 
Student: No, I did not find EECS 280 to be hard. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Well according to previous year feedback EECS203 is less hard than EECS280 
Student: I'm thinking of taking 18 credits next semester. Is that too hard? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  That is a lot of work. I would suggest taking less credits with EECS203 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest finishing EECS203 as soon as possible in order to declare the CS major 
Student: Okay, I will take EECS 203 next semester with 8 other credits. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds good 
Student: Thanks!

Student: Please help 
Advisor: [social]  280, 203, and 183 are all excellent courses to take, based on your major and previous courses! 
Student: Okay, all those are pretty easy right? 
Student: Because I have been struggling 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  All classes are around a 3 out of 5 on the easiness scale 
Student: Oh Okay 
Student: Will they be too hard for me to continue my Chinese studies and Chemistry? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  These classes alongside Chinese and Chemistry classes may be a heavier load. Consult the syllabus or professors of the classes for specfics on workload 
Student: Oh okay, but if it doesn't work out will it slow down my graduation? 
Student: If I don't take some classes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you prioritize classes that count towards your major, and only take extra classes if there is an opening in your schedule 
Student: That makes sense I guess 
Student: Am I doing well? 
Student: In general? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You seem to be right on track, credits wise! 
Student: Right on! 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: Everything is looking good then, thanks alot mr. mkbuck@umich.edu 
Student: I have everything I need 
Student: Farwell 
Student: Farewell* 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye 

Student: hi 
Student: dear advisor 
Student: i am ready to start asking questions 
Student: When should i take eecs 482? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  yes 
Student: how are you 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  no 
Student: How many pre reqs does 381 have ? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  2 
Student: how does chez betty function ? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  yes 
Student: how does it function ? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  no 
Student: Will i graduate in time ? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  no 
Student: Did you do eecs at Michigan ? What would you know ? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  yes 
Student: Should i take 280/281 during fall ? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  no 

Student: HI 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! I see you are a senior, studying CSE, is that correct? 
Student: Yup! 
Student: but i am considering switching 
Student: to art 
Student: nevermind 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  So you are no longer considering switching? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What topic interests do you have in EECS? 
Student: yup I changed my mind 
Student: I am interested in OS and web development 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  What specifically about Web development? design? databases? other? 
Student: databases 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest to pursue your OS interest, in taking EECS 482, or EECS 582, which are intro to operating systems, and operating systems respectively. 
Student: that sounds like fun! 
Student: what other classes go well with those? 
Advisor: [push-other]  I don't believe you can take both at the same time, but if you email the professor, he or she may allow it! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest EECS 485, Web Database and Information Systems to go along with it so you can learn about web development and databases 
Student: i hope so, i want to take as many OS classes as I can here 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you still have a strong desire for more EECS classes, I would also suggest taking EECS 381 to really round out your schedule! 
Student: that sounds like a fun, stress-free schedule 
Student: you are a great advisor! 
Advisor: [push-other]  You should have plenty of time for fun activities, as long as those fun activities are never stopping EECS, and never leaving the Library! 
Advisor: [social-other]  Thank you for that compliment! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  I hope this was a helpful session! please come again! 
Student: will do! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  hello! What can I help you with? 
Student: I am having trouble deciding on classes to take next semester 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I see you are an IOE major, is that correct? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in taking CS classes next semester? 
Student: Yes, that sounds interesting 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you feel you retained the concepts that you learned in ENGR 101 ? 
Student: Yes, I believe so 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Ok, then I suggest you take EECS 280 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is a good intro to object oriented programming 
Student: Ok, are there any other classes you would recommend I would take along with it? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in discrete mathematics? 
Student: Yes, that sounds interesting. Also I just forgot, I have taken EECS 280 already 
Student: What course can I take then after 280? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you're interested in taking more upper level cs classes I would recommend taking EECS 281 
Student: Ok 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 is a prerequisite for most upper level cs 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  given your interest in math and discrete mathmatics I would also recommend taking EECS 203 
Student: Ok, thank you, I will consider those options! 
Student: This has been helpful 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  That's great! Enjoy the rest of your day 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Zach. 
Advisor: [pull]  Are you here today to pick classes for next semester? 
Student: Yes, that's right. I am planning to graduate at the end of next year. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Great! It looks like you need to take 2 more upper level courses. 
Student: Are there any available next semester that you would reccomend? 
Advisor: [push]  Yes there are many available that I would recommend, depending on what you would like to Study. 
Advisor: [pull]  Are you more interested in a project based class or more theory based? 
Student: I think a project based class would be good. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  There are many project based courses, I would recommend EECS 381 or EECS 482. They are project based and very informative. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you're looking for something more fun, EECS 494 Game development is also available. 
Student: Ok. I will look into those. Thank for the suggestions. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Great! If that's all your questions, have a nice Day! 
Student: Yep. Thanks for your help! 

Student: h 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  hi

Advisor: [social-open-close]  my pleasure 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Mingyang! What can I help you? 
Student: Hi Advisor, I want to hear your suggestions on selecting the courses for the coming semester. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Sure! How many courses are you planning to take? 
Student: I prefer 2 courses 
Student: My interesting area is computer hardware 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You may want to consider EECS370 Introduction to Computer Organization, and EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithms. They are all core courses. 
Student: Can you tell me their course schedule? I am a morning person. 
Advisor: [push-other]  Sorry my database is not updated with their schedules yet. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  We might update later. 
Student: Ok, how about the class size? I prefer large class. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  They are both large classes, with about 80 to 90 people. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Do you have any other considerations? 
Student: Ok, I guess this course pair look good to me. Thank you for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You are very welcome. Good bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Looks like you've taken EECS280. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you like it? 
Student: Yes, I liked it. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in the Computer Science major? 
Student: Yes I am interested because I like computer science. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you find EECS280 difficult? 
Student: No I did not find EECS280 to be difficult. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Which classes did you take with EECS280? 
Student: I took EECS 215, Introduction to Electronic Circuits, with EECS 280. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest taking EECS281 next. 
Student: Okay. What classes should I take with EECS 281? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you like EECS215? 
Student: No I did not like EECS 215. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS370 is a computer organization class required for the CS major. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you did not like EECS215, you may not like EECS370. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  However, you should probably take EECS 370 soon if you want to major in CS. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you find EECS 215 difficult? 
Student: I did fine in EECS 215, so should I take EECS 281 and EECS 370 together? 
Student: No I did not find EECS 215 difficult. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think you should take EECS281 and EECS370 together, if you did not find either of them difficult. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  There is also the option of EECS376. 
Student: Okay I will take EECS 281 and EECS 370 together next semester. 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you finished with your Intellectual Breadth requirements? 
Student: I'm not sure that's why I came here 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I was just wondering whether you were planning on taking anymore.  I have recommendations for you to finish up your EECS major 
Student: Well if I need more then I'd love suggestions. I like Chinese but it's hard 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Certainly.  How was your Study Abroad experience? 
Student: It was amazing, definitely would do it again. Maybe I would like to go back for an internship 
Advisor: [pull]  Let's figure out which EECS courses will help you land your next internship.  Which field of Computer Science are you most interested in? 
Student: I would say Intelligent Systems but I don't have much experience with them. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I don't know EECS. Is that similar to Artificial Intelligence? 
Student: Yes that and other fields like Machine Learning, Computer Vision, etc. 
Student: You seem less informed than me 
Advisor: [pull]  Do you like smaller class sizes or larger class sizes? 
Student: I like smaller classes but not super small, just under 100 is good for me. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I recommend you take EECS 442 - Computer Vision. Have a good day. 
Student: Nice! Thank you 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-continue]  How are you? 
Student: I am doing well. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Are you interested in computer science? 
Student: Yes, I am interested in computer science! 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You will need to take EECS280 
Student: Okay. Are there any pre-requisites for EECS 280? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes you will have to take EECS183 
Advisor: [social-continue]  How do you feel about that? 
Student: Is it hard? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I see you've taken MATH156 did you find that hard? 
Student: No, not really. I enjoyed MATH 156! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Then you should have no problem with EECS183 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How many credits did you want to take? 
Student: I want to take at least 12 credits. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS183 should be manageble with a 12 credit semester 
Student: Okay, I will take EECS 183! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok. Have a nice day 
Student: Thanks, you too! 

Advisor: [pull-other]  Hi, how are you today? 
Student: I am well. How are you? 
Student: What classes should I take this upcoming semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on the courses you have taken before, you should take: EECS376, EECS281, EECS478 
Student: Are any of these classes similar to things I have taken? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see that you have taken EECS280. The next course in the sequence is EECS281. 
Student: What category does EECS 281 fall in? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It is a core class. The instructor is Igor L Markov. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is this what you are looking for major/minor wise? 
Student: Yes 
Student: What is the workload like? I am also minoring in music 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The Easiness rating is: 2.53 for EECS281 
Student: Is the instructor hard to understand? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The instructor is pretty easy to understand, he has a clarity rating of: 3.77 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Do you think this is a good fit for you? 
Student: No this class is too hard 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Oh that's too bad, maybe another class. 
Student: Thank you for helping me. Bye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Hi 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I see you have senior standing in computer science but have not completed 3 of thre required courses for the major. 
Student: Wow. I didn't realize that. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you trying to graduate this year? 
Student: I was hoping I could. Is that still possible> 
Student: ?* 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest you take EECS 376, EECS 281, EECS 370 this term. 
Student: Are those classes hard? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 is difficult. EECS 376 is difficult. EECS 370 is difficult. 
Student: I won't be taking those then. What is a really easy class? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  This would not be an easy semester. I would suggest you take another term. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  These classes are all required for your graduation. 
Student: Ok. I'll take them next semester then. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  An easy class is EECS 398 Computing for Computer Scientists 
Student: I've heard the GSIs are cool in that class. I'll probably take that as well. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Matt Terwilliger is very chill. 
Student: Fantastic 
Student: Thx for the help 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Is there anything else I can help you with tonight? 
Student: No. Thank you! 
Student: Have a great night 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem. Goodnight. 

Student: Hello Professor Lefevre! 
Student: I need to take another EECS elective 
Student: I like back end programming, and I am also interested in data analytics 
Student: I have taken a number of difficult classes, and would like to have a lighter load next semester 
Student: I am interested in machine learning, do you have any suggestions on a class I can take? 
Student: Ok, I will take that class! Thank you so much for all of your help 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you here for some advising? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are there any classes that you are interested in? 
Student: I am trying to choose between NLP and Information Retrieval. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both are excellent classes that are reasonable in workload 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you considered taking EECS 381 and 482 together? 
Student: No, I think that will be too much work for one semester. 
Student: Does NLP or Information Retrieval fulfill the upper-level CS requirement? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  As a matter of fact, they both do! 
Student: Ok, great! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any other questions? 
Student: Nope, thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  ~woo 

Student: Hello advisor! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  How are you doing? How may I help you? 
Student: Hello, I am a junior taking upper level CS courses right now, and I have done a lot of User interface and visible programming. 
Student: I do not like it that much, and I am looking for something new to take 
Student: I found that 370 was a really cool and interesting class 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you enjoy the hardware aspect of 370? 
Student: I just thought it was interesting to see how a computer actually functions, rather than creating things on the computer.  But I have already gone so far into the CS track 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest looking into EECS 445, Intro to Machine Learning and EECS 442, Computer Vision. Both course delve into those areas that you mentioned. 
Student: I hear these classes are very difficult, would I still be able to graduate on time if I isolated these classes and did not combine them with any other technical classes? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It would take a bit more time, but both classes are very rewarding and worth the effort. 
Student: Ok, thank you so much for your time, I will think things over 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Absolutely! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with in the future. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi there! 
Student: Hello, I am interested in taking eecs classes even though I have little experience 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you've taken ENG 100 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  The next step would be to take 203 and 280 
Student: Ha, true that! 
Student: Do you recommend taking those at the same time? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Many students take both at the same time 
Student: Okay, I am a little nervous taking both at the same time as my physical chem classes. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You can break up 203 and 280. The only issue will be that your skills might get rusty if you take a semester with no coding. 
Student: Do you recommend doing 203 then 280?  Or the other way around? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  203 with 280 might be the best route. If you can fit it in, 285 is a Java class that is only 2 credits. You can take it along with 203. 
Student: Okay I will do 203 and then make plans for the next semesters later 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds like a plan! Nice chatting with you 
Student: Yep 

Student: I need help with my schedule 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, what can I help you with? 
Student: Hello, I need help picking classes 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok, what grade are you in? 
Student: I am a Freshman 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What major are you thinking about? 
Student: EECS most likely 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you have already taken EECS 280 
Student: Yes indeed 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since you have already taken 280, I would recommend taking EECS 281 
Student: Ok, thank you 
Student: What else? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in the foundations of computer science? 
Student: Yes I am 
Student: I will take that and EECS 281 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Ok, that class is EECS 376 
Student: Perfect, thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem. Have a nice day 
Student: Thanks! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Hello, nice to talk to you? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  What's your major and how can I help you? 
Student: My major is CSE. I'm wondering what I should take next semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  What year are you? 
Student: senior 
Student: actually freshman 
Student: sorry I forgot 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Are you comfortable with your course now? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  For next semester, you will have to take Programming and Introductory Data Structures and Elementary Programming Concepts 
Student: that sounds so boring but ok 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's fundamental course but very important 
Student: I guess I can tough it out for one semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Sure, good luck for your course selection. 
Student: thanks 
Student: bye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello how can I help you today?

Student: I would only like to take 2 classes, as I would like to balance the difficulty of my schedule 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  OK great! I suggest you take EECS 281, and either EECS 370 or EECS 376 next semester 
Student: Okay. Which of the last two should I take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 376, this course is not project based. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Would you like to take EECS 482 the following semester? 
Student: No, I am not interested in Operating Systems 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ok, then I suggest you take EECS 281 and EECS 370 for a great semester! 
Student: Okay, thank you for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You are welcome! Anything else I can help with? 
Student: Not at this time. thanks 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  OK, have a great day!

Student: How are you doing today? 
Advisor: [social-other]  I'm doing well thank you. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How can I help you today? 
Student: I am hoping to take some smaller classes next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you like to be in a class greater than 50 people? 
Student: No I want to be in a small class. Sorry I wasn't specific. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you are willing to compromise I think EECS 203 is the best class for you. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It has an average of 55 people in the class. 
Student: Ok that sounds alright. 
Student: Thanks for your help. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: No I am all set. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Alright then, have a good day!

Advisor: [push-general-info]  hi 
Student: I'm a Phd student. I want to know what courses I should take for next semester 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I know. I have seen your information. 
Student: Which course should I take if I want to further my study in algorithm 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take 376. it is data structure and algorithm 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Oh it is 281. 
Student: Are there any descriptions about the course? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Introduction to algorithm analysis and O-notation; Fundamental data structures including lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, hash tables, binary trees, search trees, balanced trees and graphs; searching and sorting algorithms; recursive algorithms; basic graph algorithms; introduction to greedy algorithms and divide and conquer strategy. Several programming assignments. 
Student: Any other suggestions? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  376 is another class I think you might like. 
Student: What's it about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is Foundations of computer science 
Student: Oh, I think that's pretty useful 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  An introduction to computation theory: finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity. 
Student: Looks good to me! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Any other questions > 
Student: Thank you for your suggestions.

Student: what does that mean 
Advisor: [push-other]  Class size or lecture size between 100-200 students 
Student: no 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  How rigorous of a work load do you want to take next semester? 
Student: very rigourous 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Are you looking to take EECS classes next semester? 
Student: I love bananas 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  How against are you from taking larger classes? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In how many more years do you plan on completing your degree? 
Student: .5 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest you take EECS 281, however it is a large class size. 
Student: uh oh 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would also suggest that you take EECS 370, and EECS 376. 
Student: sign me up 
Advisor: [push-other]  Keep in mind that these are all required courses for your degree. 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-other]  You will not be able to finish next semester, but if you want to finish as soon as possible, you will have to take all three of those courses. 
Student: o

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hi, I was wondering if you could help me choose classes for next semester 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Of course! 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you looking for upper level CS courses? 
Student: I'm looking at possibly taking a CE course, I really enjoyed taking EECS 270 last winter. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest EECS478: Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimizations 
Student: Who is the professor that is teaching it next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  John Patrick Hayes, he has a clarity rating of 1.5 and a helpfulness rating of 1.5 
Student: Sounds interesting...are there any other classes you'd recommend with better professors? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case I would suggest EECS370: Introduction to Computer Organization. It is taught by Profressor Mudge who has a clarity rating of 4.28 and a helpfulness rating of 4.31 
Student: That sounds perfect! I will definitely look into that next semester 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Any other questions I can help with? 
Student: Nope, I'm good 
Student: Thank you so much! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem, have a good day 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, how can I help you? 
Student: Hi, I was wondering what I should take next semester. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take two classes as a combination of EECS 376, 370 and 281 
Student: That sounds too hard. I would like to take morning classes if possible and those classes all start at 0:00 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you want to take morning classes, I would suggest you take EECS 376 and 281 
Student: That sounds like a good idea. I think I will do that. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Ok, that sounds good, is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: I have to run to my next class. I think I'm good. Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem, good luck 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Hello 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you enjoy taking EECS 280 last semester? 
Student: Yes, it was a great class. I learned a lot, but it was definitely challenging 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Great! Then 281 might be a course that you want to take next semester. 
Student: Okay, what else can I take with 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Generally, I advise students to take EECS 370 along with 281 as that opens corridors to a lot of upper level CS courses. 
Student: How much of a workload is that according to students generally? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  While a lot of students might buckle under the stress, given the courses you've taken and coped with in previous semesters, I would say you should be able to handle it 
Student: Okay, then I will take them both. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What other types of classes do you think you would be interested in? 
Student: Cooking 
Student: I'm kidding 
Student: I can't cook 
Student: I would like to take more Spanish classes 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Yes that would be a great choice, if you've enjoyed your classes so far in Spanish. 
Student: Ok for sure. I will look into more classes to take. Thank you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem. Hope you have a good day. 

Student: WAZZZZUP 
Student: So I've been taking classes all over and still have to take my ULCS classes, which class do you think is best for me? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  It depends on what your interests may be. You still need to take 370, which some ULCS classes require.In the meantime, the most popular seem to be 484, 493, and 492. 
Student: 484, no way Jose. I've heard that class is boring. 
Student: I am really interested in Operating Systems, so I think I should take 370 to fulfill the requirements for it. 
Student: Is 493 an useful class? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Absolutely. You will learn a lot about front-end/back end interactions and front-end code. A lot of students feel that this is a good class. 
Student: Great, sounds like a fun time! I'll take it! Now for the other 2 classes, should I take two more ULCS classes or just take humanities so I don't die by the end of the semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I would suggest taking a look at the eecs survey to get a feel for course workloads. 493 tends to be lighter by comparison. 
Student: Isn't that your job? 
Student: Tell me how hard 493 is. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I can tell list off the difficulties one by one if you'd like, but I'd be wasting both of our times. 493 tends to be on the lighter side, as I stated before. 
Student: Alright, thank you, so I should take 370, 493, 381, 482 in one semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would definitely not suggest doing this. That seems like a major workload. 
Student: Great, now we're back to square one. 
Student: This session was highly unsuccessful, I was not please. Real human interactions are preferable. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Couls you elaborate on that please? 
Student: Bye felicia 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Take care 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello there 
Student: Howdy 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How's the semester going? 
Student: Pretty solid. I'm struggling with some of my intro CS courses though. I'm not sure if the CS life is for me 
Student: Can you console me? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Well I'm sorry to hear that. I suggest you take a year off to get yourself together. What do you think about Peru? 
Student: I love llamas 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  We have great study abroad programs here at U of M 
Student: and I've heard machu pichu is dope 
Student: I haven't could you tell me more about them? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Confirmed. Is dope 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Our study abroad programs span 113 countries! 
Student: Solid let's do it! What 4 classes can I take while I'm abroad? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I suggest you take EECS 376, EECS 281, EECS 475 and EECS 370 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You have to take those classes to graduate 
Student: Sold! You had me at llamas! I'll make my arrangements 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you can't handle them I suggest you drop out 
Student: Do you know what I think? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  No. 
Student: I'm gunna drop out 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye. 

Advisor: [push-general-info]  What is your major? 
Student: CSE 
Student: What kind of course should I take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  how bout an art class to balance out the CS? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like art? 
Student: kind of like design 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Perfect! How about intro to design at stamps? 
Student: Sounds cool, are there any required class that I should take next semester as a CS major? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  No 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What else can I help you with? 
Student: How many courses will suggest to take? 
Student: or credits? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest no more than 16 credits 
Advisor: [pull-select]  How many are you taking now? 
Student: 15 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you comfortable with that amount? 
Student: yeah, I am comfortable 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Well we've reached 15 lines. Hope the advice was helpful today! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: I am thinking about taking EECS 485 next semester. What do you think? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 485 is very useful class 
Student: What other classes should I take with it? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I you take EECS 485, I suggest you take EECS 376 
Student: What is EECS 376? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 376 is Foundations of Computer Science. The description: An introduction to computation theory: finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity. 
Student: Do I have  to take 376? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 376 is required to graduate 
Student: Do I need any other classes to graduate? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  That is all you need left to graduate 
Student: Do you have any other suggestions for me? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take EECS 441 as your MDE 
Student: WIll that be too much work for one semester? 
Advisor: [push-other]  That may be a difficult semester but you can do it 
Student: Are the class sizes for 441 small? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Class sizes for 441 are around 49 
Student: That is good. I like small classes. 
Student: Is it in the afternoon? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is at 3:00pm 
Student: That is a good time for me. I like afternoon classes. 
Student: This sounds like a good schedule. I will take 441 and 376. 
Student: Thank you and goodbye 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Is there anything else you need help with? 
Student: No that is everything. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  i guess not goodbyye 
Student: Goodbye 

Student: 你好 
Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi what can I help you? 
Student: Could you give me some suggestions about selecting courses? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which level of courses would you like to take, easy courses, medium courses or hard courses? 
Student: I don't like easy courses, hard or medium is fine 
Student: Besides, I won't take cousese in morning 
Student: course 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Which topic are you interested in? 
Student: I would like to learn about database. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you mind taking a course with a large class size? 
Student: I have no perference for the size 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since you have taken EECS 281 and have a preference in database, I strongly suggest EECS 484. 
Student: How about the clarity of this course? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The clarity rating for this course is 3.74, and the easiness rating is 3.05. 
Student: OK, I think this fits me well! 
Student: I will take it 
Student: Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-other]  You are welcome. 
Student: Bye. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  See you? 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  do you need some help to register for classes next semester 
Student: Sort of. I'm not sure what courses I should take next semester. 
Student: Do you have any recommendations? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  do you want to take eecs280 or eecs203? 
Student: I don't have a heavy course load in my other classes, so is it possible for me to take both? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  great. how many classes do you want to take next semester 
Student: I'm thinking about around 16 credit hours 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  okay if you want to take eecs280 and eecs203, i suggest you don't take other heavy eecs or math classes 
Student: How is the difficulty of EECS 280 outside of class? How much of a time commitment do I need outside of class 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  maybe you want to give at least 10 hours each week for eecs280 
Student: That sounds reasonable according to my workload. How about 203's time? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  it depends, maybe about 4 hours each week 
Student: All right, thanks for your help. 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Hi, how may I help you? 
Student: I'm not sure what courses to take next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are you looking for courses to complete your requirements or courses for fun? 
Student: For my requirements, mainly. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well based on your prior course history, I'd suggest EECS281, 376, or 380 
Student: Which one is the easiest? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  370 is the class with the highest clarity. 
Student: Which class would be more useful? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Both 370 and 281 are extremely helpful. 
Student: Okay thanks I'll consider those two options. 

Student: HI 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  are you having fun in eecs 
Student: kind of 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  great as your advisor I suggest you take EECS698, Master's Thesis 
Student: that sounds like a lot of work 
Student: what other classes would go well with that? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS381 and EECS482 
Student: great, that sounds like a fun schedule! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  also EECS995 Dissertation candidate 
Advisor: [social-other]  yes very easy 
Student: How much free time will i have with this schedule? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  you will have all the free time 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  you got into UofM, after al 
Student: you're right the sky is the limit 
Student: maybe i should take another class along with those? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  yes I was about to say you can throw on EECS470 for funsies 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  are you intersted in any other topics? 
Student: I enjoy physics also 
Student: can i take a quantum physics class as well 
Student: it seems like a great way to round out my schedule 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  yes hw about physics 420 
Student: i'll give it a shot 
Student: 420 is my favorite number after all 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  what a coincidence 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  is there a reason for that? 
Student: nah 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  ok sunds good. bye 
Student: thanks for your wise advice! 

Student: Hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, what can I help you with? 
Student: I need help deciding on what to take next semester. I have taken the basic computer science foundation courses and my gened requirements. What should I take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on the courses that you have already take, you need to take some computer science courses. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you are okay with a more difficult semester, I would suggest EECS281, EECS370 and EECS 376 
Student: My friend told me he did that one semester and failed. I don't want his fate to be mine. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest taking a combination of the two and then picking a flex tech as well 
Student: I told you that's too hard! I don't think I can do it. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Don't worry, if you fail, you can retake those classes for up to 3 semesters. 
Student: When are these classes? I'm a morning person. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Which classes do you want to know the time of 
Student: When is EECS 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 starts at 00:00 and ends at 00:00 
Student: That should work for me! 
Advisor: [social-other]  I'm glad I could help you 
Student: Thanks! Have a good day. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You too 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: I don't know what class to take next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It looks like you haven't taken EECS 281 yet. It might be a good idea to take this since its a gateway to a lot of the upper level CS classes 
Student: I don't know if i wanna take 281 yet 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Why does 281 not seem appealing to you? 
Student: Because i hear its hard 
Student: how hard is it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 281 is a 2.5/4 on the EECS course difficulty survey. It's a hard class, but not overwhelmingly so. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In my opinion its about as hard as physics 240 which you took last semester 
Student: Okay I guess I'll take it then 
Student: Thanks 
Student: g2g 
Student: where'd you go? 
Student: ADVISOR?? 

Student: HELLO 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  how is your dog 
Student: it's pretty ok 
Student: how's your dog? 
Advisor: [social-other]  I don't have one 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  To continue with your major you need to take eecs280 and eecs203 
Student: can i just take eecs280 this semester 
Student: eecs is hard 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  no i suggest you take both 
Student: ok 
Student: are there any electives I can take that would pair well with those two classes? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS381 as a fun elective 
Student: i've heard from others that EECS381 is very easy, it should be nice alongside hard courses such as EECS280 and EECS203 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  yes you heard right. it should be a nice gpa boost 
Student: great, maybe i could even add another easy course along with those? 
Student: since EECS381 is pretty trivial 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  how about stats1 
Student: that sounds a little bit too difficult 
Student: is there a stats0 i can take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  you should take stats-1 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I do not think you are bright enough for normal classes 
Student: ohhh you're right i totally forgot about that class 
Student: you're right maybe i should drop out 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  yes I suggest you drop out 
Student: yes why didn't I think of that 
Student: thanks for the help, I couldn't have done this without you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  no problem, I'm glad to be of help. good byye 
Student: byee 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi I am your course advisor. How can I help you? 
Student: Hmm I would love to hear your suggestions on the course selection for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How many courses do you expect to take? 
Student: I am thinking about probably two to three EECS courses 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Is there a specific area that you are interested in? 
Student: Well I am a little into Computer Hardware 
Student: Web app is also cool 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Considering your interest, I think EECS 373: Design of Microprocessor Based System, EECS 470: Computer Architecture, EECS 485: Web Database and Information Systems, EECS 484 Database Management Systems will be most relevant to your interest. 
Student: I can't take all these in one semester right? I heard 470 is extremely hard 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your preference for workload, I think the answer is yes. You can just take the rest of the three classes. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Do you have other questions for me? 
Student: Is any of these classes in the morning? I really don't like taking morning classes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 373, EECS 470 and EECS 485 are all in the morning period. However, EECS 373 and EECS 470 are from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm, which is not very early in the morning. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You might not want to take EECS 484, because it is from 9:00 am to 10:30 am, Monday and Wednesday. 
Student: NOOOOO That sucks. 
Student: Are there any other intersting courses that are offered in the afternoon? 
Student: Or do you think I could survive any of those courses without going to the lecture? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Considering your interest on web app application, I think you might also want to consider EECS 441: Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs. This course will also involve UI interface, and will be helpful for you to find jobs. It is in the afternoon, from 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm. 
Student: Ok I will consider that 
Student: Thanks a lot 

Student: hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, I'm Jackie. I'm here to help you with your 4 year class plan. Nice to meet you. What can I help you with? 
Student: What class do you suggest I take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It seems to me that you have not finished all of you upper level classes yet. I'd suggest you to take some, like 482. That's a popular one 
Student: Thanks! 
Student: What MDE should I take if I want an easy one? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 441 has a lighter workload, but I highly recommend you to take one based on your interests, and not just easiness level. 
Student: What class is EECS 441 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs - would you be interested in that class? 
Student: No, I hate mobile apps. 
Student: Is there another one I can take? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 481 is also a lighter workload MDE, Software Engineering 
Student: Ok, thank you buddy! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  hi 
Student: Hi 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What do you need help with? 
Student: I want to register class for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What class do you want to register for? 
Student: maybe eecs492 or eecs442 but i'm not sure. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest taking EECS 280 or EECS183 next semester. 
Student: But I've already taken these 2 courses before 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  According to the schedule I have, you have not met the preresquitities of EECS 492 or 442. 
Student: okay i'll take them next semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Is there any other courses you wish to register? 
Student: no, maybe just these 2 eecs classes 
Student: thanks so much for your help 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, how are you today? 
Student: I'm doing well. I'm interested in taking some upper level EECS courses, but I'm not sure which ones I want to take 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you prefer morning or afternoon classes? 
Student: Definitely afternoon. I like to stay up late and sleep in 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Because of your schedule preference, I would suggest taking EECS 493, which is from 4:30 to 6 on Tuesdays and Thursdays 
Student: That sounds like a good class! What is the easiness level of that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 493 is a relatively easy class, you could take another EECS class with it easily 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Which classes that you have taken have you enjoyed? 
Student: I really like EECS 281 and 203 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Because of your interests, I would suggest taking EECS 376 because it is required for the major, and EECS 477 because of your interest in algorithms 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Any other questions? 
Student: those both sound like really good classes! 
Student: no I am good for now, thank you for your help! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a nice day! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Jule, how are you today? 
Student: Not well, I am super stressed about scheduling 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Why is that? 
Student: I don't know what to take 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take EECS 280, it is a required class for a CS major 
Student: What is the class size like? I like about 100 students in my classes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 280 typically has class sizes around 167 students. I think you will excel. 
Student: I only take classes in the morning, will that be okay? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I'm not sure what time that class starts, but I really think you will enjoy this class regardless of the start time 
Student: This is taking forever, i have class soon 
Student: What else should I take? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  I'm sorry. I have a lot of students to advise right now. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  I would also suggest you take EECS 203 along with EECS 280 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS280 and EECS203 tend to go well together 
Student: Okay I will take  eecs280 eecs203, physics 240, and eecs 281 
Student: I was also considering orgo 
Student: and calc IV 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I don't think that is a very well balanced schedule. You do not want to overload yourself with too many difficult, high workload classes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Also, you cannot take EECS 281 until after you have passed both EECS 280 and EECS 203 
Student: oh okay! Thank you so much 
Student: I have to go to class, bye! 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  I see you've taken a couple ECON classes as well, do you like ECON? 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What sort of classes are you interested in taking next semester? 
Student: I am looking to change my major to EECS this year. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  How exciting! Go on. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Have you taken any EECS classes thus far? 
Student: I wasn't happy with my previous courses and I wanted to change my major. I took 101, 280, and 203 
Advisor: [social-other]  Wow incredible! 
Student: 4 more years 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I strongly suggest you take EECS 281, EECS 370, and EECS 376 together next semester! :) 
Student: That sounds like a lot of work... 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  They are all required classes to graduate with a Computer Science degree. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How much more time do you want to spend at U of M? 
Student: I really enjoy College 
Student: How many hours a week would I be spending on work for those classes? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  A lot of hours. Given your background, you may be overwhelmed by this courseload. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Perhaps you can just take EECS 281 this semester. 
Advisor: [social-other]  Since it will allow you to stay in college even longer 
Student: I like the way it sounds. What other courses would you suggest to round out my nice 12 credit schedule? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your interest in Philosophy, Archaeology, and German, I would strongly taking Yoga, Musicology, and Dance courses to round out your schedule. 
Student: Awesome! Sounds like a very well rounded global semester! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Great, have a fun one! 
Student: Peace and Love 

Student: hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hey sweet pea!!

Student: I cannot elaborate 
Student: I feel cold and alone in this world 
Student: Can you help me? 
Advisor: [social-other]  I am here for you <3 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking to fulfill requirements? 
Student: All day, everyday 
Advisor: [social-other]  awesome possum!!!! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I am going to suggest you take some upper level EECS courses 
Student: That sounds challenging 
Student: How should one ensure that they pass EECS courses whose number exceed 280 
Advisor: [social-other]  Great q great great q 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You have done okay in the other classes so I think you can handle the challenge 
Advisor: [social-other]  I believe in you. 
Student: Oh baby when you talk like that, you make a woman go mad 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Can you elaborate? 
Student: My dairy based beverage brings all those with a y chromosome to the stretch of land behind my dwelling 
Student: That is all I have to say, goodbye 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye sweetie 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken EECS281? 
Student: Yes, in Winter 2012 
Student: Can I take EECS482 next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, you can take EECS 482 next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which one do you like more, system, web or software development? 
Student: I prefer system. 
Student: Will the workload be too heavy if I take EECS482 and EECS373 in one semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your background, you may find it difficult to take the two courses in the same semester 
Student: Can you recommend me an upper level CS course to take together with EECS482? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I recommend EECS484, which is database management systems. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Go on. 
Student: Do I meet the prerequisite for EECS484? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Yes, you meet the prerequisite for EECS484 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like EECS492 AI? 
Student: No, it's boring. 
Advisor: [push-other]  Cool 
Student: Thank you, that's very helpful. 

Student: Do I need to take Calc 4? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No, you have already taken Calc 1,2, and 3 which is all that is required to graduate. 
Student: What about for a spanish minor? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  No, spanish and calculus have no intersection. 
Student: No I would like to minor in spanish 
Student: What does that entail? 
Student: I like large classes. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I only have information regarding engineering courses. 
Student: What courses would you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 280 and EECS 203 seem like the best courses for you next semester. 
Student: Are they required? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, 280 and 203 are required courses for a computer science major. 
Student: Thanks 
Student: Goodbye 
Advisor: [social-other]  You're welcome! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye! 

Student: *waves* 
Student: Does MECHENG211 count as a flex tech??????? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Howdy 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, MECHENG211 counts as a flex tech 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you like late classes? 
Student: Negative 
Student: What have you got in the late variety? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 482 has a late lecture this upcoming semesters. 
Student: Is the professor good? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Peter Chen is the the professor teaching the course. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  He's chill 
Student: Great. I will enroll. 
Student: You have been very helpful 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Is there anything else I can do for you today? 
Student: No 
Student: Have a nice night 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You too! Bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Sarthak. It is nice to see you. 
Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What brings you in today? 
Student: I want advice on what classes to take next semester and what my requirements are 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well for next semester I think you should take EECS 281 and EECS 370. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Lots of students take EECS 281 and EECS 370 together. 
Student: That's a good idea! How do people do in those classes when they take them together? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Students manage to get through the classes. However it will not be easy. EECS 370 has a difficulty rating of 3.24 and EECS 281 is 2.53. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you have a hard time in EECS 280? 
Student: I did not. I found the class very enjoyable. 
Student: But not as enjoyable as I find this conversation. 
Student: Do you have any other recommendations? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  No, EECS 370 and EECS 281 is a good combo. 
Student: Thank you so much, I don't have any other questions. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Thanks for stopping by today. Have a great life. LLAP. 

Advisor: [pull-other]  What classes are you looking to take next semester? 
Student: Hi! I want to major in EECS, do you have any suggestions for what I should take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You need to take EECS 281 in order to major in EECS. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  However, since you are a senior, it is impossible for you major in EECS and graduate on time if you have not taken EECS 281 at this point. 
Student: Oh 
Student: Can I minor in EECS instead? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes you can minor in EECS! I suggest you take EECS 281 next semester. 
Student: I am also very interested in Earth sciences, physics, and statistics. 
Student: Do you have any suggestions for an elective I can take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can take any other electives you wish as long as your other requirements are fulfilled. 
Student: Perfect, thank you so much! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Feel free to reach out with any other questions! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi 
Student: Hello 
Student: I am unsure of what class to take 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What is your major? 
Student: Computer Science 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  And you're a sophomore, correct? 
Student: yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since you're a sophomore in computer science that hasn't taken 280 and 203 yet, I'd recommend taking EECS280 and EECS203 along with another 4 to maybe 6 credits depending. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Maybe those two classes with your 300 level humanities requirement or STATS250. 
Student: Thank you that sounds great! 
Student: I will probably end up taking that with my 300 level humanities 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sure, sounds good. Have a nice day! 

Student: Hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What can I help you with today? 
Student: I'm planning on taking 281 but I don't know what other classes to take with it 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS281 is a pretty difficult course, I would suggest taking an easy class with it 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Do you have any classes in mind? 
Student: Maybe another CE class? 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you're looking for a CE class, I would recommend taking EECS373: Design of Microprocessor Based Systems. According to other students, it has a higher easiness rating and would go well with EECS281. 
Student: That sounds good, thanks 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  No problem, I hope I answered all of your questions. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Varsha! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How can I help you today? 
Student: Hi, I'm trying to decide what upper level classes to to take 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you enjoy EECS 270? 
Student: Maybe 
Student: I didn't like or dislike it 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  If you liked EECS 270, you might like EECS 478. EECS 478 is Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization. 
Student: I don't really like digital logic 
Student: I'm more interested in software development 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you considered EECS 484? 
Student: What is that? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 484 is Database Management Systems. 
Student: Are there a lot of projects? 
Advisor: [push-other]  Hmmm I'm not sure. You'd have to talk to the professor for that class. 
Student: Who is the professor? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  The professor for EECS 484 next semester is Cafarella. 
Student: Ok thanks 
Student: Am I missing any classes that I need to graduate? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You still need to take EECS 376 and EECS 370 to graduate. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  But don't worry you still have plenty of time! 
Student: ok thanks 

Student: Hey! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! 
Student: Can you help me pick a few classes? 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Of course! What are you looking for? 
Student: I'm not really sure. I'm kind of lost 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Well you still have a few classes required for graduation 
Student: Oh shoot, what are they? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would suggest EECS281 and EECS376 for someone in your position 
Student: I've heard EECS281 is really hard. What if I fail? 
Student: Am I allowed to take it again? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can take the class again if you fail 
Student: Okay. 
Student: And what is 376 about? 
Student: Is it a big class? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  As it is a required class, it is usually a larger class size 
Student: Okay, that's fine I guess 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Is there anything else you would like help with? 
Student: No, i'm fine 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Ok perfect. I'm glad I could help 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello World! 
Student: I'm not sure which area I want to go into. I'm thinking of taking classes in computer hardware, web technology & applications, software development, infrastructure, or intelligent systems. What do you suggest I take? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which one do you like more: web or software development? 
Student: Well, which is easier? 
Advisor: [social-other]  Let me check the workload survey! 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  You can check past students' rankings yourself at http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/undergraduate/survey/all_survey.2016.htm 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on the workload survey, I see no significant difference in difficulty between EECS 481 and EECS 485 
Student: If I'm more interested in EECS 485, do you recommend any other classes to take before or while I am taking it? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your interest in web applications, you might enjoy taking EECS 388 with EECS 485 
Student: Oh cool! Can I take both of those next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Not next semester. You will need to take EECS 281 before you can take EECS 388 and EECS 485 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  If you would like to take two EECS classes next semester, you can take 370 with 281 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Especially if you would like to take EECS 388, EECS 370 will be helpful 
Student: Okay great! I think I know what to take next semester :) Thank you! 

Student: Hi 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello 
Student: Can you help me out 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Sure, what do you need? 
Student: Looking for a class for next semester 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  To fulfill a prerequisite? 
Student: Yeah 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your course history, I'd look into 281, 370, or 376 next 
Student: Cool. I just want to take the one that will help me the most with interviews this coming semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It depends a bit but usually 281 is the core class for interviews. 
Student: Okay what do you mean it depends, though? 
Advisor: [push-other]  Like if you're interviewing for places that will ask you about computer architecture or low-level subjects, you'd be better off taking 370. 
Student: Gotcha. I won't be. So is 281 the best choice? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would say so. 
Student: Cool thanks. Could you give me a brief description of it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Sure, 281 is about data structures and algorithms. You'll be learning about the fundamental topics required for most interviews and will also be doing several projects that will help you practice your use of data structures/algorithms. 
Student: That sounds super useful. Think I'll take it. Thanks! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello Sydney! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  What classes do you need to take next semester? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  What topics are you interested in? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your interests, you may want to take EECS 489. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How difficult do you want the class to be? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS 489 has a heavy workload and many students find it difficult. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest that you take 373. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What other classes do you want to take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 545 is a good class for Machine Learning. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It is also relevant to your interests in data analytics. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You're welcome! Have a great day 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Greetings. 
Student: Hi there!  Could you help me with backpacking? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Sure! What courses are you considering? 
Student: In general, I'm interested in software development and web development. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What about those two subjects interests you? 
Student: I would like to explore some new topics, and based on my programming experience, I think it would be good to learn more about either of those subjects. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Interesting! Go on! 
Student: I've taken EECS 280 and EECS 203.  I would like to branch into more advanced computing topics. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 280 and 203 are prerequisites for EECS 281. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since you've taken both of those prereqs, you should take 281 next semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I strongly recommend taking 281 as soon as possible to take Upper Level Computer Science courses early on. 
Student: Great!  Are there any other EECS classes I should take? 
Student: I don't mind having a heavier course load. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you want to get your Major course requirements out of the way early on, you could enroll in either EECS 370 or EECS 376. 
Student: Okay.  What are those classes like? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  376 is about the theory of computation, so much of your course work will involve proofs and formulae. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It is a 4 credit class with no lab or prerequisites, but it does have a discussion. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  My mistake; it does in fact have a prerequisite. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 370, on the other hand, is Computer Organization and how to design an efficient system of hardware-software interaction. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It, too, is 4 credits, has no lab, has a prerequisite, and has a discussion. 
Student: Oh, interesting.  Which class is easier? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  370 has an easiness score of 3.24 as opposed to 376's easiness score of 1.91. 
Student: Hm. This is a difficult decision. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Are your interests more theoretical or application-based? 
Student: I would say application-based. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case, you may want to take 370 along with 281 next semester. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Many students take that combination. 
Student: Ok, that sounds great. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Is there anything else I can help you with? 
Student: No, I think that's all.  Thanks! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Good-bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Howdy. 
Student: Howdy there, partner! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What can I help you with? 
Student: I am interested in learning more about what classes to take.  I am interested in software and web development. 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which do you prefer, web or software development? 
Student: As of right now, I think I would prefer web development. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you be interested in taking EECS 183? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  183 includes a web development application as its final project. 
Student: I don't think so.  I have already taken ENGR 101, which covers a lot of the same material as EECS 183. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on that, you might want to look into EECS 280. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I strongly suggest that freshmen get a head start on EECS 280 immediately after 101. 
Student: I would like to hold off on EECS 280 for now.  Are there any easier courses I could try? 
Advisor: [push-other]  Unfortunately, no. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Given your interest in web development, I think you'd enjoy EECS 280 very much. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The class introduces you to data structures and algorithms. 
Student: That does sound relevant to my interests.  What is the workload for EECS 280? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 280 is a 4 credit course. 
Student: Thank you.  What do previous students think about the class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  280 has an easiness rating of 2.59, a helpfulness rating of 4.13, and a clarity rating of 3.96. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I think that you would be well suited for this course. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What else would you like to ask? 
Student: That helps so much.  I have no more questions! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Glad to hear it. Good-bye! 

Student: Hey miss EPAZPA 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello young brem. How can I help you today 
Student: How many credits should i take this semester 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  What grade are you going to be in this year? 
Student: I am a senior of course! 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You should take 12-14 credits so you have plenty of time to enjoy Ann Arbor 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you taken an MDE yet? 
Student: Oh, that is a good idea. I want to enjoy my last year at school 
Student: I have not. Should i take it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes! You need an MDE to graduate 
Student: Which do you suggest 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 494, video game design and development! I hear the IA is super cool :) 
Student: I hate that IA. Do you have other suggestions 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  It turns out that all the other classes are full. Looks like you are stuck 
Student: Ok, thank you for the information. I have decided to leave this school 
Advisor: [social-other]  Have fun at OSU where you will play school and not learn!!!!!!! 
Student: goodbye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello! How can I help you? 
Student: I need to figure out classes for next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Ok, what kind of classes are you interested in? 
Student: I have no particular interest. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Ok, I might recommend getting your core courses, EECS 376 and EECS 370, out of the way first. 
Student: That sounds like a good idea. Do either of those classes meet in the morning? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  We actually don't have data for either of those class' meeting time. Try coming back later! 
Student: Ok. Which of the courses is easiest? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 370 is the easier of the two. 
Student: Does EECS 370 have a clear professor? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, Robert Dick is a very clear professor. 
Student: Ok I will plan on taking that course. 
Student: Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds good! No problem! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi there! How are you doing? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in Computer Science? 
Student: Hi! 
Student: I am fine. 
Student: Yes, I am interested in the Computer Science major. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you like Engineering 101? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS183 is the LSA equivalent to that class. 
Student: Yes I liked ENGIN 101. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you like calculus 1 and 2? 
Student: Yes, I took Calculus I and Calculus II. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take EECS203 next (Discrete Math). 
Student: Okay. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Discrete Math is a pre-requirement for the CS major. 
Student: Can I take EECS 281? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  No, EECS281 must be taken after EECS280. 
Student: Can I take EECS 280 and EECS 203 together? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you like to take EECS280? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, you can take EECS280 and EECS203 together. 
Student: Okay, I would like to take EECS 280 and EECS 203 next semester. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Sounds like you have your plan for next semester! 
Student: Thank you! 

Student: Hello, Mr. Advisor! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Why hello, how are you doing? How can I assist you? 
Student: I have taken a breadth of technical electives, but I am not sure which degree to pursue at this time. 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Are there any degrees particularly on your mind? or do you have no inclination? 
Student: I was particularly intrigued by EECS 280, but it was not the easiest course. 
Student: I am also interested in pursuing a degree in a department with a smaller class size. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have you heard of SI? 
Student: I have not. What is SI? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  SI stands for the School of Information.  It deals a little bit less with programming, and generally has easier programming courses.  The difference is you focus more on data analysis rather than just programming as a whole. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Does this seem like something that interests you? 
Student: Yes, it does interest me! 
Student: However, I haven't taken any courses in SI, and most of the courses I've taken so far have been general electives. Is it possible to take SI courses next semester to get a feel for the department? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Absolutely! I suggest you take SI 110, it is the intro course and has no pre-requisites.  As far as your general electives, a lot of the classes you have already taken actually overlap with the graduation requirements, so you do not need to worry too much.  Keep in mind also, that you must apply to the School of Information in order to graduate with a SI degree 
Student: Thank you very much for your feedback! 
Advisor: [social-other]  Of course! Any time dychang! Have a great day! and Good luck with your career! 

Student: Hello

Advisor: [social-continue]  Good, what do you want from me? 
Student: I AM STRESSED AND DONT KNOW WHAT I WANT TO TAKE 
Student: HELP!!!!! 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 183 to learn how to code!! 
Student: I dont want to code 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Well, if you don't want to code, you could take EECS 203 
Student: lol aight 
Student: what is 203 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Introduction to the mathematical foundations of computer science.

Student: xo 

Student: hello 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Hello! How can I help you? 
Student: I would like to ask a question about classes for next semester 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  ok 
Student: I talked with my advisor for microbiology, and he said I could take another EECS course to fulfill my microbiology requirement if I really liked EECS. I was thinking of doing EECS 388, but it says it has a preferred prerequisite of EECS 370, and I have not taken that. Should I take it? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Why do you want to take 388 in particular 
Student: If I decided to major in CS, I would probably focus on computer security or AI because they seem interesting to me 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Your major is still microbiology, right? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I will say directly taking advanced CS courses may not be a very good option, because as your advisor mentioned, they had very high requirements and some pre-requirements. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your records, you may want to take more low level CS courses before Ai or security, such as 370 
Student: Okay, that sounds pretty good. Thank you! 

Advisor: [pull]  hello 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you an EECs student? 
Student: Yes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What EECS courses have you taken so far? 
Student: EECS481, EECS493, EECS281, EECS376, EECS370 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you looking to take another EECS course? 
Student: Yes 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your course history, I suggest you take EECS478 or EECS475 
Student: Ok, can you tell something about EECS475? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Cryptography plays a fundamental role in building secure computing and communication systems. With its fascinating history through centuries and intriguing connections to deep mathematical ("how quickly can we factor an integer?") and philosophical ("what is randomness?") questions, Cryptography is an important and beautiful subject. With increasing concerns over privacy, security, and authenticity of data and communications in our wired (and wireless) society, cryptographic applications are bound to pervade our lives. Cryptography is, and will continue to be, a vast and exciting area of research in Computer Science and Mathematics. This course is an introduction to the art and science of cryptography. At the end of the course, students should be well-prepared to apply the core scientific principles of cryptography to build secure software and communication systems as well as to pursue more advanced courses and state of the art research in cryptography. This course will study fundamental concepts, algorithms, encryption schemes, and protocols in cryptography. Main topics include: symmetric (private key) encryption, public key encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, and key distribution. The course emphasizes a rigorous mathematical study of the various cryptographic schemes and their security in terms of algorithmic complexity. A nontrivial part of the course will be devoted to algorithmic and mathematical background from number theory and algebra needed to gain a solid understanding of cryptography. Popular cryptographic schemes such as AES and RSA will be highlighted and their security will be rigorously investigated. Detailed syllabus is available from the course web site (link below). This is a 4-credit course approved as an upper-level CS technical elective for undergraduate students in CS-ENGR and CS-LSA. This course is also approved as a cognate course for Math Majors. Advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in Computer Science and Engineering and Mathematics are invited to take this course. Graduate students in EECS can also take it as a 400-level elective course. Grading will be based on homework assignments, a mid-term, and a final project/term paper. 
Student: What kind of EECS courses there are? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  For winter 2014, these are the courses available: EECS376, EECS281, EECS478, EECS475, EECS370 
Student: I want to know something about EECS478. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  EECS478 (Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization) is available during Winter 2014. Taught by professor Armin Alaghi, EECS 478 is a 4 credit course focusing on advanced design of logic circuits. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Have I answered all your questions? 
Student: Yes. 
Student: It is really helpful. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  It's been great chatting with you ssyssy. Have a nice day! 
Student: Thank you. You too. 

Advisor: [push-general-info]  Don't take 482 
Student: Ok, I will not take 482. 
Student: Should I take 441 or 481? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take 441 if you have an interest in mobile development 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you enjoy mobile development? 
Student: I have no experience with mobile development but it seems interesting 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Which type of mobile apps do you use the most? 
Student: I use social media apps the most 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Do you prefer Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram? 
Student: I use Twitter the most out of those three 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  You should be careful with Twitter, as it is losing power in the social media world 
Student: Ok I will do that. Is 441 of comparable difficulty to 481? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 441 and EECS 481 are both relatively the same difficulty 
Student: Ok I will take 441 then. Thank you. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a good day. 
Student: Thanks you too. Goodbye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  How's your sophomore year going, Eduardo? 
Student: It's ok, just trying to get all my pre-reqs out of the way. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  You've taken a lot of science courses.  Are you hoping to major in a Natural Science? 
Student: No but I might minor in it or a related major like Physics. 
Advisor: [pull]  How do your Politics courses fit into your interests? 
Student: I thought they might be cool but I'm getting kind of sick of it. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you enjoy EECS 
Student: With all my heart 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest you take EECS 203 in order to take the next programming course in the curriculum, EECS 281 
Student: Ok! 

Student: Hi 
Student: What classes should I take next semester? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You took Statistics and Databases, so you should consider taking courses like Machine Learning and Computational Modeling of Cognition 
Student: Of those two courses, which one is harder? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  That depends, do you prefer large or small class sizes? 
Student: I prefer small class sizes. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you prefer small class sizes, I suggest you take Computational Modeling of Cognition 
Student: That class sounds boring. Are there other similar classes that I might consider instead? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Which is more interesting to you, theory or applications? 
Student: Definitely applications. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Since you prefer applications, Electronic Commerce or Software Engineering would be good fits for you. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a good day! 
Student: Cool, thanks. 

Student: Hi professor, I come to ask for advice on selecting courses next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you interested in computer software? 
Student: Not exactly, I'm more interested in hardware. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Then I recommend you to take EECS 373 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Do you have any question about this course? 
Student: Yes, does it have any prerequisite courses? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Yes, this course do have prerequisite. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on courses you have taken, you will be able to handle 373 
Student: Ok, and I wonder what the size of this course is. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Around 40 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have any other question? 
Student: No, thank you! Goodbye! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye 

Student: Hi! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, what can I help you? 
Student: I want to get suggestions about course selection 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  OK, what topics are you interested in? 
Student: My major is Artificially Intelligence in Computer Science Department 
Student: So I prefer courses related to this area 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you take any courses related to artificial intelligence before? 
Student: No 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Based on your background, I suggest you taking EECS 492. 
Student: what is the class size and the difficulty level? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The class size for EECS 492 is 124, and the easiness rate is 3.08. 
Student: let me think for a momoent 
Student: I hope this class is helpful to me 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The helpfulness rating for this course is 3.92. 
Student: Nice 
Student: Is it hard or easy 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The easiness rating for this course is 3.08. 
Student: OK I will take it! 
Student: Many thanks! 
Student: Bye1 
Student: ! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You are welcome! Bye! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Helo 
Student: Helo der 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Are you alive and well today? 
Student: I am thank you. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What is your favorite class you have taken or are currently enrolled in? 
Student: My favorite class I have taken is SI 301 because it challenges me to work harder than ever before 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  That's really interesting. You should try out SI 206. 
Student: Ok I will do that thank you. 
Student: What is SI 206 about? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  SI 206 introduces Model-View-Controller, as well as how to develop web applications on a small scale using Python and Jinja Templates. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You should take this class. 
Student: That sounds very interesting justin. 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Please, tell me more about yourself 
Student: I am a current senior and that is the last class I am enrolling in 
Student: That is all the help I needed. Thank you 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye! 
Student: Goodbye 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Student: Hey 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What is your advising issue today and how can I help? 
Student: I am interested in selecting interesting course for the coming semester 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Well, what interests you? Math, Science, Art? We have all that and more here at UM. 
Student: Math and science mostly 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Well, it says here that you are a sophomore. Are you looking for classes within your major or no? 
Student: 3 classes within my major and I would also like to explore a class from a different field 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Okay. We have some classes from your major that you still need to complete such as EECS 281, 376, and 370. But those aren't too interesting. So for the different class, perhaps a class from the school of information would be a good fit. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Or, you know, biology 
Student: School of information sounds interesting, can you tell me more about specific courses offered? 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  They offer some great web design classes that prepare you for a future as a front-end developer. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
Student: sure 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Great I would suggest looking into these course numbers that I just made up: 223, 430, 220 
Student: I'll go with 220 since its the smallest number 
Advisor: [social-continue]  Fantastic! Do you need anything else? 
Student: That's it for me 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Goodbye. 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi Varsha! 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What can I help you with today? 
Student: Hi, I'm about to fail EECS 482 and I don't know what to do 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  That's okay! Have you talked to the professor yet? They will usually try to work with you to help you do better 
Student: I've tried going to office hours but they are always full 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You can also try emailing your professor to set up a separate time to meet. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Do you have a study group? 
Student: I have a project group but they aren't very helpful 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Working in groups is part of the educational journey. It can be hard to learn to work with people who have different learning styles. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Talk to your GSIs and IAs about other students that are struggling. Maybe you all can get together and form a study group outside of your project group. 
Student: Ok thanks 
Student: But what happens if I still fail the course? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You can retake the course up to one more time if you want. 
Student: I don't really want to retake it 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You still need 3 other upper level CS classes. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What else are you interested in? 
Student: I'm interested in artificial intelligence 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Great! We have a class on artificiall intelligence. You could take EECS 492 next semester! 
Student: How many credits is it? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 492 is 4 credits. 
Student: ok thanks 

Student: Hello! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi! 
Advisor: [pull-other]  How mayI help you? 
Student: I need help planning my classes for next semester, I do not know what I can and cannot take? 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Sure. What major are you? 
Student: I am planning to a Computer Science Major 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How many EECS courses would you like to take next semester? 
Student: 3 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  Since you have not yet taken EECS 281, I would recommend taking EECS 281. You may also take EECS 370 and EECS 376 
Student: Ok cool 
Student: Thank you for your help ! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  You are welcome. Have a nice day 

Advisor: [pull-bool]  yes 
Student: Hi, I want to take a class for Calculus II? 
Advisor: [pull-select]  Ok, that's fine 
Student: Will it be hard? 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Yes 
Advisor: [pull-other]  Most failed class at U of M 
Student: What's the differences between Calculus II and I? 
Student: II and III? 
Advisor: [pull-other]  But it says on your transcript that you already took it? Did you fail the first time? 
Student: Oh, I see 
Advisor: [pull-other]  calc 1 and 2 aren't that different though. 2 is just harder 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Did you pass calc 2? 
Student: Yeah, I passed it 

Student: Hey 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  yo dog 
Student: Do you have any suggestions for math classes I should take? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  sure. what are you looking for in a math class? 
Student: I would prefer a 3 or 4 credit class 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  i see that you haven't taken math 203. it is a 4 credit class 
Student: Great. 
Student: Are there any other eecs classes that you suggest to take next semester? 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  no idea. bye 
Student: Okay....Thanks! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello, there!  How can I help you today? 
Student: I was wondering what classes I should take for next semester. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  I see that you've taken EECS281.  What fields of CS are you interested in? 
Student: I'm interested in computer hardware, software infrustructure, and computing 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  In that case, I would recommend EECS482. 
Student: What's the average class size for 482? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  Generally, there's 99.6 people in that class. 
Student: Perfect! How clearly do the professors orate in said class? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  According to the data, the professors generally orate pretty well. 
Student: Great! Are there any classes about the theory of computation that you recommend? 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I would recommend EECS477 if that's your field of interest. 
Student: At what time of day is that class generally taught? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS477 is taught early in the morning. 
Student: Ok, how early in the morning? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It starts at 10AM and lasts for an hour and a half. 
Student: Wow, that's great! You've been really helpful, thanks for all the advice. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Yeah, no problem! 

Student: hello 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hello. Welcome to advising. 
Student: Thank you! I have a question about my graduation date. 
Student: I'm very undecided with my major, but I would like to graduate on time. 
Student: Do you think I could still graduate in 4 years? I am thinking about declaring CS. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  Are you interested in CS? 
Student: Yes! I wasn't able to take CS classes in high school, but I think now I really want to major in it. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  You are on track to graduate with a degree in CS in four years. 
Advisor: [push-tailored-info]  I suggest that next semester, you take EECS 281. You can also take EECS 370, but the two classes will be a lot of work together, and we don't recommend it. 
Student: Okay, it seems like I found 280 and 203 really difficult. I am unsure if I can handle it >_< 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you found those classes difficult, then you may not want to major in CS. You should speak to a general CoE advisor. 
Student: Oh, that is so sad. Okay. I will make an appointment. Thank you! 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Have a good day! 

Advisor: [social-open-close]  Hi, How are you? 
Student: Hello, I am fine. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What are your thoughts on your schedule next semester? 
Student: I'm trying to find a class in Web Technology & Applications or Intelligent Systems. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  Well, there's EECS 485, Web database and Information Systems. 
Student: I greatly prefer morning classes, so is there a morning session for that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  I actually don't know. 
Advisor: [push-conditional]  If you are interested though, you could see when you are backpacking. 
Student: Ok.  What is the workload of that class? 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  It's a 4 credit course that is a bit on the easier side. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How are you with large class sizes? 
Student: I don't like being in very large classes around 250 or 150, but 100 or 50 is fine. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  The course is about right in the middle at approximately 128 students. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  What else are you interested in? 
Student: Intelligent Systems or Software Development. 
Advisor: [pull-bool]  Would you be interested in graduate level courses at 500 and above? 
Student: So long as they aren't too difficult. 
Advisor: [pull-fill]  How many credits are you looking for? 
Student: 2 or 3 credits is fine. 
Advisor: [push-general-info]  EECS 547 is not too hard and is 3 credits. It deals with how systems interract online within financial settings. 
Student: That sounds good, thank you. 
Advisor: [social-open-close]  Oh. Glad I could help!
