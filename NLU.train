I was a GSI for EECS 523, and I did not like Prof Schertz at all; I thought she was condescending and rude.

I think Prof Marcotte makes some of the materials in his CNS class (EECS 498) harder than they need to be.

I'm currently a GSI for EECS 417 (Design of Microprocessor Based Systems), and while the class is indeed difficult (which UM class isn't, really?), I did learn a lot of things.

I did GSI for EECS 561 (Digital Communication Signals and Systems) with Prof Moody, and it was a wonderful experience - one of the best GSIs ever; I learned so many new things.

Although I do feel that the course material for EECS 561 (Digital Communication Signals and Systems) was somewhat dry and un-interesting considering UM EECS standard, I feel there need to be some courses like this where students can be freer and more themselves than stressed out and unforgiving.

When selecting courses, I tend to choose the ones where Prof's personality matches mine; otherwise, there can be a lot of friction and subsequent unhappiness, as was the case in EECS 523 with Prof Schertz.

When I compare among all classes I took so far at UM, I feel that EECS 542 (Design of Digital Control Systems) has so far been the best experience (probably because I studied compilers in summer).

I think classes should have a component where students get to present, and/or discuss their own ideas/thoughts; I perceived a distinct lack of such activities in EECS 523 lectures and discussions.

Overall, EECS 523 turned out to be one of the most disappointing, disgusting, depressing, and disastrous experiences of my time at UM.
